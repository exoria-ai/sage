# Special Districts in Solano County

## What Are Special Districts?

Special districts are local government agencies that provide specific services within defined boundaries. They operate independently from cities and the county, with their own governance (usually elected boards) and funding (typically property taxes, fees, or assessments).

## Why Special Districts Matter for Property Owners

### 1. Property Taxes

Special district assessments appear on your property tax bill. You may be paying for:
- Fire protection district
- Water district
- School district bonds
- Mosquito abatement
- Resource conservation

### 2. Service Providers

When you need a service, you contact the **district**, not necessarily the city or county:

| Need | Contact |
|------|---------|
| Fire protection (rural) | Your fire protection district |
| Agricultural water | Irrigation district |
| Sewer connection | Sewer district or city |

### 3. Development Requirements

Building projects may require:
- "Will serve" letters from water/sewer districts
- Fire district review and approval
- District fees and connection charges

## LAFCO (Local Agency Formation Commission)

**Solano LAFCO** oversees special district boundaries and changes:
- Annexations
- Detachments
- Consolidations
- Sphere of influence updates

Contact: (707) 439-3897 or solanolafco.com

### Sphere of Influence

Each district has a "sphere of influence" - the probable future service area. Land in a district's sphere may be annexed in the future but isn't currently served.

## Finding Your Districts

A property may be in multiple overlapping districts:
- One fire district
- One or more water districts
- One sewer district
- One or more school districts
- Resource conservation district
- Various special assessment districts

### How to Determine Districts

1. **Property tax bill** - Lists all districts collecting taxes
2. **County GIS** - District boundary layers
3. **LAFCO maps** - Official boundary documentation
4. **Contact districts directly** - They can verify service area

## Common Questions

### "Who provides my fire protection?"

Depends on location:
- **In a city**: City fire department
- **Unincorporated**: Fire protection district
- **SRA (wildland)**: CAL FIRE primary, local district may assist

### "Can I connect to city water/sewer?"

If outside city limits, you may need to:
1. Annex to the city, OR
2. Connect to a special district, OR
3. Use private well/septic

LAFCO approval may be required.

### "Why do I pay taxes to districts I don't know?"

Property tax bills include all applicable districts. Some (like mosquito abatement or resource conservation) provide area-wide services even if you don't interact with them directly.

### "Who do I contact about [service]?"

| Service | In City | In Unincorporated Area |
|---------|---------|------------------------|
| Water | City water dept | Water district or private well |
| Sewer | City sewer dept | Sewer district or septic |
| Fire | City fire dept | Fire protection district |
| Parks | City parks dept | County or none |
| Roads | City public works | County public works |

## For SAGE Responses

When users ask about special districts:

✅ **Do**:
- Explain what type of district they're asking about
- Note that service providers vary by location
- Suggest checking property tax bill for applicable districts
- Provide contact info when known

❌ **Don't**:
- Assume city services apply in unincorporated areas
- Confuse districts with county departments
- Ignore the distinction between district boundaries
