### What Zoning Tells You

✅ **Zoning indicates**:
- What uses are potentially allowed (permitted, conditional)
- Minimum lot size requirements
- Setback and height limits
- Density restrictions

❌ **Zoning does NOT tell you**:
- Whether you can actually build (permits still required)
- Whether your specific project is approved
- Environmental constraints
- Easements or deed restrictions
- Whether utilities are available

## City Zoning (General Patterns)

Each city has its own zoning code. Common patterns:

| City | Residential Pattern | Commercial Pattern |
|------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Fairfield | R-1, R-2, R-3, etc. | C-1, C-2, etc. |
| Vacaville | RS, RM, RH | CN, CC, CR |
| Vallejo | R-1, R-2, R-M | C-1, C-2, C-3 |

For city-specific zoning questions, refer to that city's municipal code or contact the city planning department.

## Common Questions

### "Can I build an ADU?"
Zoning allows certain uses, but ADUs have additional state law requirements. See `adu-rules.md`.

### "Can I run a business from home?"
Home occupations may be allowed with restrictions. Check specific zone regulations and get a business license.

### "Can I subdivide my property?"
Depends on minimum lot size, General Plan designation, and subdivision regulations. Contact Planning.

### "What if my use isn't listed?"
Unlisted uses may require a Use Permit or Zoning Administrator interpretation.
