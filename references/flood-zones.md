# FEMA Flood Zone Reference

## Flood Zone Classifications

### High-Risk Zones (Special Flood Hazard Areas - SFHA)

| Zone | Description | Key Facts |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **A** | 1% annual flood risk, no BFE | High risk, insurance required for mortgages |
| **AE** | 1% annual risk, with Base Flood Elevation | Most common SFHA designation |
| **AH** | 1% annual risk, shallow flooding (1-3 ft) | Ponding areas |
| **AO** | 1% annual risk, sheet flow (1-3 ft) | Alluvial fans, sheet flooding |
| **AR** | 1% annual risk, temporary (levee repair) | Levee being restored |
| **A99** | 1% annual risk, federal project underway | Future protection coming |
| **V** | Coastal high hazard, no BFE | High velocity wave action |
| **VE** | Coastal high hazard, with BFE | Strictest requirements |

### Moderate-to-Low Risk Zones

| Zone | Description | Key Facts |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **X (shaded)** | 0.2% annual risk (500-year flood) | Moderate risk, insurance recommended |
| **X (unshaded)** | Minimal risk | Low risk, insurance still available |
| **D** | Undetermined risk | Not enough data, may be high or low |

## Understanding the 1% Annual Chance Flood

The "100-year flood" terminology is misleading. Better to understand:

- **1% annual chance** = In any given year, 1% probability of flooding
- **26% chance** over a 30-year mortgage of experiencing this flood
- Does NOT mean "once every 100 years"

## Insurance Implications

### SFHA Zones (A and V zones)

| Situation | Insurance Requirement |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Federally-backed mortgage | **Flood insurance required** |
| No mortgage or private lender | Strongly recommended |
| Minimum coverage | Building coverage required; contents optional |

### Outside SFHA

- Insurance optional but available
- **Preferred Risk Policy** often available at lower cost
- ~25% of flood claims come from outside SFHA

## Base Flood Elevation (BFE)

**BFE** is the elevation (in feet, usually NAVD88 datum) that floodwater is expected to reach during a 1% annual chance flood.

### Why BFE Matters

| Application | How BFE is Used |
|-------------|-----------------|
| New construction | Lowest floor must be at or above BFE |
| Substantial improvement | May trigger elevation requirements |
| Insurance rates | Relationship of floor to BFE affects premium |
| Flood damage assessment | Determines "substantial damage" threshold |

## Letters of Map Change

Property owners can request changes to flood zone designations:

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **LOMA** | Letter of Map Amendment - property is higher than mapped |
| **LOMR-F** | Letter of Map Revision based on Fill - fill was placed |
| **LOMR** | Letter of Map Revision - larger area change |
| **CLOMR** | Conditional LOMR - proposed project |

### Getting a LOMA

If you believe your property is incorrectly mapped in an SFHA:
1. Obtain elevation certificate from licensed surveyor
2. Submit LOMA application to FEMA
3. If approved, property is officially removed from SFHA
4. May eliminate mandatory flood insurance requirement

## Solano County Flood Hazard Areas

Major flood sources in Solano County:

| Source | Areas Affected |
|--------|---------------|
| **Sacramento River** | Rio Vista, eastern county |
| **Napa River** | American Canyon area |
| **Putah Creek** | Winters/Dixon area |
| **Green Valley Creek** | Green Valley |
| **Suisun Marsh** | Suisun City, eastern county |
| **Local drainages** | Various urban areas |

## Floodplain Development

Building in flood zones requires:

1. **Floodplain Development Permit** (from local jurisdiction)
2. **Elevation Certificate** (for new construction)
3. **Engineering analysis** (if affecting floodway)
4. **No-rise certification** (for floodway development)

⚠️ **Floodway vs Flood Fringe**
- **Floodway**: Channel plus adjacent area needed to convey flood - very restricted
- **Flood fringe**: SFHA outside floodway - development allowed with conditions

## For SAGE Responses

When reporting flood zones:

✅ **Always include**:
- Zone designation and what it means
- Whether it's an SFHA (affects insurance requirements)
- BFE if available
- Recommendation to verify with FEMA or surveyor for official determination

❌ **Never say**:
- "You won't flood" (even in Zone X)
- "You don't need insurance" (always can be beneficial)
- "This is the official determination" (GIS is reference only)
