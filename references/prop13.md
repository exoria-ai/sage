# Understanding Assessed Value and Proposition 13

## The Basics

**Proposition 13** (1978) fundamentally changed California property taxation:

1. **Assessed value** is set at purchase price (the "base year value")
2. Assessed value can only increase by **maximum 2% per year**
3. Reassessment to market value only on:
   - Sale/transfer of ownership
   - New construction
   - Change in ownership (with some exclusions)

## Why Assessed Value ≠ Market Value

Because of Prop 13, a property owned for 20+ years may have an assessed value far below its market value.

### Example

| Scenario | Assessed Value | Likely Market Value |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Bought in 2000 for $200,000 | ~$325,000 (with 2%/yr growth) | $600,000+ |
| Bought in 2020 for $500,000 | ~$550,000 | $550,000-600,000 |

## Reading Assessed Value Data

When you see assessed values from the parcel layer:

| Field | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| **Land Value** | Assessed value of the land only |
| **Improvement Value** | Assessed value of structures |
| **Total Assessed Value** | Land + Improvements |
| **Base Year** | Year of last reassessment (often purchase year) |

### Interpretation Tips

- **Old base year** (1970s-1990s) → Likely significantly below market value
- **Recent base year** (last 5 years) → Closer to market value
- **Very low improvement value on developed parcel** → Old base, not "cheap construction"

## Proposition 8 (Prop 8) Reductions

**Prop 8** (1978, different from the 2008 ballot measure) allows:

- Temporary reduction in assessed value when market value drops below assessed value
- Assessor reviews annually
- Value "floats" back up as market recovers (up to factored base year value)

### Why This Matters

During market downturns (2008-2012, or local declines):
- Properties may show assessed values above current market value
- Or they may have Prop 8 reductions in place
- Assessed value is NOT a reliable indicator of current market value

## Common Questions

### "Why is my neighbor's assessed value so low?"
They likely bought long ago. Prop 13 protects their base year value.

### "Does this affect my property taxes?"
Yes. Property tax is approximately 1% of assessed value (plus voter-approved bonds/assessments).

### "Can I appeal my assessed value?"
Yes, if you believe it exceeds market value. Contact the Assessor's Office.

### "What triggers reassessment?"
- Sale or transfer
- New construction (only the new portion)
- Change in ownership (some exclusions for transfers between spouses, parents/children per Prop 19)

## For SAGE Responses

When reporting assessed values:

✅ **Do say**:
- "The assessed value is $X, which reflects Proposition 13 limitations"
- "Note: Assessed value often differs significantly from market value"
- "The base year is [year], indicating the last reassessment date"

❌ **Don't imply**:
- Assessed value = market value
- Low assessed value = undesirable property
- Assessed value is useful for pricing decisions
