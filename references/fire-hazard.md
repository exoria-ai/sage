# Fire Hazard Severity Zones (FHSZ) Reference

## Understanding Fire Hazard vs Fire Risk

| Concept | Definition | What It Measures |
|---------|------------|------------------|
| **Fire Hazard** | Physical conditions that affect fire behavior | Terrain, vegetation, weather |
| **Fire Risk** | Probability of fire occurring | Ignition sources, human activity |

**FHSZ maps hazard, not risk.** A remote area with dense chaparral has HIGH hazard but may have LOW risk (few ignition sources). An urban area may have low hazard but higher risk (more ignition sources).

## FHSZ Classifications

| Classification | Description | Building Code | Defensible Space |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Moderate** | Lower fire hazard | Standard code | Recommended 100 ft |
| **High** | Significant hazard | Chapter 7A required | Required 100 ft |
| **Very High** | Extreme hazard | Chapter 7A + enhanced | Required 100 ft |

## State vs Local Responsibility Areas

| Area Type | Who's Responsible | Where Found |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **SRA** (State Responsibility Area) | CAL FIRE | Wildland areas, unincorporated |
| **LRA** (Local Responsibility Area) | Local fire department | Cities, some county areas |
| **FRA** (Federal Responsibility Area) | Federal agencies | National forests, federal land |

### Why This Matters

- **SRA Very High FHSZ**: Strictest requirements, CAL FIRE jurisdiction
- **LRA Very High FHSZ**: Similar requirements, local enforcement
- Fire prevention fees may apply in SRA

## Building Requirements (Chapter 7A)

Properties in High and Very High FHSZ (in SRA) or designated areas (in LRA) must meet California Building Code Chapter 7A:

### Ignition-Resistant Construction

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Roofing** | Class A fire-rated |
| **Eaves/Soffits** | Enclosed, ignition-resistant |
| **Exterior walls** | Ignition-resistant or non-combustible |
| **Windows** | Tempered glass, dual-pane |
| **Vents** | Ember-resistant (1/8" mesh or better) |
| **Decks** | Ignition-resistant materials |

### When Requirements Apply

- New construction
- Additions and alterations (varies by scope)
- Substantial remodels
- Re-roofing (roofing requirements only)

## Defensible Space Requirements

**PRC 4291** requires defensible space around structures in SRA and LRA Very High FHSZ:

### Zone 0 (0-5 feet from structure)
- "Ember-resistant zone"
- No combustible materials
- Hardscape, gravel, or low-growing fire-resistant plants

### Zone 1 (5-30 feet from structure)
- Lean, clean, and green
- Reduce vegetation density
- Remove dead/dying plants
- Prune trees (limbs 6ft from ground)
- Separate tree crowns by 10 ft

### Zone 2 (30-100 feet from structure)
- Reduce fuel continuity
- Create horizontal spacing between shrubs
- Remove ladder fuels (vegetation connecting ground to trees)
- Maintain grass at 4" or less

## Solano County Fire Hazard Areas

| Area | Typical FHSZ | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Green Valley / Suisun Valley | High to Very High | Wildland-urban interface |
| Eastern hills | High to Very High | Grass and woodland |
| Urban areas | Moderate or None | Lower hazard |
| Agricultural lowlands | Moderate | Grass fire potential |

## Fire Safe Regulations (PRC 4290)

For new development in SRA and LRA Very High FHSZ:

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| **Road width** | Minimum 20 ft (one-way) to 24 ft (two-way) |
| **Road grade** | Maximum 16% |
| **Turnarounds** | Required every 2,640 ft |
| **Driveway clearance** | 13.5 ft vertical, 10 ft horizontal |
| **Address signage** | Reflective, visible from road |
| **Water supply** | May require hydrants or water storage |

## Insurance Considerations

Properties in High and Very High FHSZ may face:
- Higher insurance premiums
- Limited insurer availability
- Non-renewal notices
- California FAIR Plan as last resort

### Recent Changes (Insurance Crisis)

Many insurers have reduced coverage in fire-prone areas. Options include:
- Shop multiple insurers
- California FAIR Plan (state backstop)
- Mitigation improvements may help

## Permits and Inspections

| Activity | Permit/Inspection Required |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Burn permits | Required in SRA for debris burning |
| Defensible space | Annual inspection in some areas |
| Vegetation management | May need permit for tree removal |
| New construction | Fire plan review required |

## For SAGE Responses

When reporting fire hazard zones:

✅ **Always include**:
- FHSZ classification (Moderate, High, Very High)
- SRA vs LRA designation
- Basic defensible space mention
- Note that this affects building and insurance

❌ **Never say**:
- "You're safe from fire" (no area is completely safe)
- "Insurance won't be a problem"
- Specific building code requirements without caveat to verify current code
