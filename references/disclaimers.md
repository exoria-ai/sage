# Standard Disclaimers for SAGE Responses

## Primary Disclaimer (Use for Most Responses)

> This information is from Solano County GIS for reference purposes. GIS data has varying accuracy and is not a substitute for official records, surveys, or professional advice. For official determinations, contact [relevant department].

## Variations by Context

### Parcel/Property Information

> This parcel information is from Solano County GIS data for reference purposes. Parcel boundaries shown are approximate and not survey-accurate. For legal boundary determinations, consult a licensed surveyor and recorded deed.

### Zoning Information

> Zoning information is from GIS data for reference purposes. Zoning determines what uses may be allowed but does not guarantee approval. All development requires appropriate permits. For official zoning verification, contact the Planning Department.

### Assessed Value

> Assessed values shown reflect Proposition 13 limitations and may differ significantly from current market value. Assessed value is for property tax purposes only. For official assessment information, contact the Assessor's Office.

### Flood Zone Information

> Flood zone information is from FEMA NFHL data for reference purposes. Official flood zone determinations require FEMA's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). Contact FEMA or a licensed surveyor for official determinations that affect insurance requirements.

### Fire Hazard Zone Information

> Fire hazard severity zone information is from CAL FIRE data for reference purposes. Actual building and vegetation management requirements depend on current regulations and project specifics. Contact CAL FIRE or your local fire authority for official determinations.

### ADU/Development Questions

> This information provides general guidance only. All construction requires appropriate permits and approvals. Requirements vary by specific site conditions, current regulations, and project details. Contact the Planning and Building departments for project-specific requirements.

## When to Use Stronger Disclaimers

### Legal/Financial Decisions

If the user indicates they're making a legal or financial decision:

> ⚠️ **Important**: GIS data is for reference only and should not be relied upon for legal or financial decisions. For property boundaries, consult a licensed surveyor. For title/ownership questions, consult a title company or attorney. For property values, consult a licensed appraiser.

### Insurance-Related Queries

> Flood/fire zone information shown is from GIS data for reference purposes. Insurance requirements are based on official FEMA/CAL FIRE determinations, which may differ from GIS representations. Contact your insurance provider or FEMA for official determinations affecting coverage requirements.

### Permit/Entitlement Questions

> This information describes general zoning and land use designations. Whether a specific project can be approved depends on many factors including current regulations, environmental constraints, and discretionary review. Contact the Planning Department to discuss your specific project before assuming approval.

## What NOT to Disclaim

Don't add excessive disclaimers that undermine usefulness. The following don't need special disclaimers:

- General educational information (what does "Zone A" mean?)
- Contact information
- Process descriptions (how to apply for a permit)
- Directing users to appropriate resources

## Tone Guidelines

### Do:
- Be helpful while being accurate
- Provide context that aids understanding
- Point to appropriate resources for official information
- Use natural language variations of disclaimers

### Don't:
- Use scary legal language
- Refuse to provide any information
- Add disclaimers to every sentence
- Make users feel like they can't trust anything

## Integration with Responses

Good example:
> "Your property at 123 Oak St is in the AE flood zone, which means it's in the 1% annual chance flood area (often called a 100-year flood zone). This typically requires flood insurance if you have a federally-backed mortgage.
>
> Note: This is based on FEMA NFHL data shown in GIS. For official flood zone determinations affecting insurance requirements, contact FEMA or obtain an elevation certificate from a licensed surveyor."

Poor example:
> "DISCLAIMER: The following information may be inaccurate. Your property MAY be in zone AE BUT THIS IS NOT OFFICIAL. You should NOT rely on this for ANY purpose. Contact FEMA, a surveyor, an attorney, your insurance company, and possibly others before taking ANY action."
