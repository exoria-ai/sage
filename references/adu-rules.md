# ADU (Accessory Dwelling Unit) Rules in Solano County

## State Law Baseline (AB 68, AB 881, SB 13, AB 2221)

California state law establishes minimum ADU rights that local jurisdictions cannot restrict further:

### By-Right ADUs (No Discretionary Review)

| Type | Requirements |
|------|-------------|
| **Detached ADU** | ≤1,200 sq ft, single-story, 4ft side/rear setbacks, 16ft height |
| **Attached ADU** | ≤1,000 sq ft or 50% of primary dwelling (whichever is less) |
| **Conversion ADU** | Convert existing space (garage, basement, etc.) - unlimited size |
| **JADU** | ≤500 sq ft, within primary dwelling footprint |

### State Law Protections

- **No lot size minimum** for single-family zones
- **No parking requirement** within 1/2 mile of transit
- **No owner-occupancy requirement** (until 2025, then varies)
- **60-day ministerial approval** timeline
- **No impact fees** for ADUs under 750 sq ft

## Unincorporated Solano County ADU Rules

The County ADU ordinance follows state law with these local standards:

### Residential Zones (R-R, R-S, R-TC, etc.)

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| Max size (detached) | 1,200 sq ft |
| Max size (attached) | 1,000 sq ft or 50% primary |
| Height | 16 ft (single story) or 18-25 ft (two story where allowed) |
| Setbacks | 4 ft side/rear |
| Parking | 1 space (unless transit exemption) |

### Agricultural Zones (A-20, A-40, etc.)

⚠️ **Different rules apply in agricultural zones**

Agricultural zones use the concept of **"Secondary Dwelling"** or **"Farmworker Housing"** rather than ADU:

| Zone | Secondary Dwelling Rules |
|------|-------------------------|
| A-20 | Generally requires 20 acres minimum |
| A-40 | Generally requires 40 acres minimum |
| A-80 | Generally requires 80 acres minimum |

**However**: State ADU law may override some local restrictions. Consult Planning.

### Key Local Requirements

1. **Utilities**: ADU must connect to public sewer OR have approved septic
2. **Fire**: May require fire sprinklers (coordinate with fire district)
3. **Access**: Must have legal access to public road
4. **Design**: Should be compatible with primary dwelling character

## Common ADU Questions

### "Can I build an ADU on my property?"

Depends on:
1. ✅ Zoning allows residential use
2. ✅ Property meets minimum lot size (or state exemption applies)
3. ✅ Adequate sewer/septic capacity
4. ✅ Fire access requirements can be met
5. ✅ Flood zone requirements can be met

### "Do I need permits?"

**Yes, always.** Even though ADUs are "by right," you still need:
- Building permit
- Electrical, plumbing, mechanical permits
- Possibly fire sprinkler permit
- Septic permit (if not on sewer)

### "Can I rent out my ADU?"

Generally yes, subject to:
- Local rental regulations (if any)
- Short-term rental restrictions (many jurisdictions limit)
- Owner-occupancy requirements (varies)

### "What about JADUs?"

**Junior ADUs (JADUs)** are:
- Max 500 sq ft
- Must be within existing primary dwelling
- Must have efficiency kitchen (small sink, cooking appliance, limited counter)
- Often require owner-occupancy

## Fire Hazard Zone Considerations

Properties in **High** or **Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones** may have additional requirements:
- Fire-resistant construction (Chapter 7A)
- Defensible space (100 ft)
- Fire sprinklers
- Enhanced access requirements

See `fire-hazard.md` for details.

## For SAGE Responses

When answering ADU questions:

✅ **Always mention**:
- Jurisdiction matters (city vs county)
- Permits are still required
- State law provides baseline rights
- Contact Planning for specific project review

❌ **Never say**:
- "You can build an ADU" (without caveats)
- "No permit needed"
- Specific approval without knowing all site conditions
