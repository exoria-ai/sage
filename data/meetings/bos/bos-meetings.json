Chair Mashburn further \nstated the limitations may reduce the ability of farm stand operators to earn \nan income, as there are times when stock is not being grown on the property \nfor all farming operations. Chair Mashburn voiced concerns over the ability of \nCode Enforcement to enforce the recommended percentages. \nDeputy County Counsel Holly Tokar stated the recommendation from the \nPlanning Commission was to allow for a 50/50 split between agricultural \nproducts grown within the County and those grown with the agricultural \nregion.\nMr. Calder stated the department will be asking for a Farmbudsman position, \nnoting the position would be a single point of contact which could be \nimportant for Resource Management and the agricultural community.\nA lengthy discussion period was held. \nIn response to comments from Supervisor Vasquez regarding the limitations \nlisting out products puts on growers, Mr. Calder stated while the code does \nlist certain products it also states \"products including but not limited to\" which \nprovides interpretation for other products to be sold.\nSupervisor Vasquez recommended adding the language \"products that can \nlegally be grown in the State of California\".\nPage 6\nSolano County\n\nJanuary 14, 2025\nBoard of Supervisors\nMinutes - Final\nSupervisor Williams commented on the need for clarification on \nrequirements for the various regions, noting that the goal for the Suisun \nValley is that a specific percentage of wine must be sold from within the \nregion. Supervisor Williams recommended additional language regarding \nparticular regions. \nA discussion period was held. \nSupervisor Vasquez recommended creating the position of an Economic \nOmbudsman which would follow specific projects and identify if the project \nmeets the Board's priorities. \nChair Mashburn requested staff research if the County has the ability to use \nregulation to create exclusivity in the sale of alcoholic products, given that \nthe licensure for the sales and dispensation of alcohol are state regulated. \nChair Mashburn further questioned if the County can tell growers what \nalcohol they can serve.\nIn response to Chair Mashburn's comments, Ms. Curry stated the County's \nauthority is to adopt zoning regulations, and through zoning regulations, the \nBoard can control the type and location of the sale of alcohol. \nIn response to the proposed amendment to Section 28.01, Article II of \nChapter 28, Chair Mashburn stated it should state \"an agricultural product \nfrom the region\" and should not be limited to 50%.\nSupervisor Vasquez commented on the need to remove the wording \"within \nSolano County, Owned or leased\", noting that some property owners own \nland in multiple counties, and this limits their ability to sell a product that they \ngrow in other areas of the region. \nIn response to the comments, Mr. Bezek stated staff received feedback from \nthe agricultural community before putting together the zoning code \namendment, and the agricultural community indicated they wanted \nexclusivity to both the regions and the County.\nA discussion period was held. \nIn response to the discussion, Ms. Curry stated the Board can adopt the \nordinance today, which will allow staff time to work with farm stand owners \nand the agricultural community to see if the distinction between in-county \nand out-of-county and/or the percentages have an actual impact.

So ordered by a 5-0 vote. (see Resolution Book)\nEnactment No: Resolution No. 2025-66\nITEMS FROM THE PUBLIC con't\nThere were no additional items from the public. \nBOARD MEMBER COMMENTS AND REPORTS ON MEETINGS\nChair Mashburn invited members of the Board to make comments or reports on\nmeetings. The following comments were received:\nA) Supervisor Brown requested that this meeting of the Solano County Board of\nSupervisors be adjourned in memory of Adolofo Alcala Manuel. Supervisor\nBrown further commented on an upcoming item on the City of Vallejo City\nCouncil Agenda, to adopt a resolution approving funding for a contract with the\nSolano County Sheriff\u2019s Department for the provision of public safety officers,\nnoting she would like to know when the Board of Supervisors will be discussing\nthis item.\nIn response to Supervisor Brown\u2019s question, Assistant County Administrator Ian\nGoldberg stated once the City Council moves through their discussion, staff will\nwork to bring the item back to the Board in open session. Mr. Goldberg further\nstated the County has not entered into a contract with the City of Vallejo at this\ntime, they have simply had an initial discussion through the Sheriff\u2019s office. Mr. \nGoldberg further stated once an additional discussion with the City of Vallejo\nhappens where they indicate if they are interested in pursing a contract staff will\nbring the item back to the Board. \nSupervisor Brown asked if there will be discussions regarding monetary\ncompensation regarding the amount of staff time that has been used should the\nCity of Vallejo want to pursue a contract, noting the law expires in 2026.\nB) Chair Mashburn stated he needs to clarify a few points for public and request\nthe Board's approval for staff to bring forward an agenda item. Chair Mashburn\nfurther stated it was published in several newspapers that he had participated in a\ncommittee set up by Solano County\u2019s Assembly representative with regard to the\nconcept of ship yard build in Collinsville. Chair Mashburn further stated he is not\non a committee reviewing the project, nor has he participated in any of the\nmeetings, noting in his current role it would not be appropriate. Chair Mashburn\nfurther stated he won\u2019t be participating in any meeting until this issue comes\nbefore the Board. Chair Mashburn requested staff provide a presentation on April\n22, 2025, that covers specifically what is and is not allowed in the General Plan\nwith regard to Collinsville and the properties in that area that are designated as\npotentially available for the maritime industry. Chair Mashburn further requested\nstaff provide as part of that presentation anything that has been submitted related\nto the proposal/project to ensure the Board has more than rumor or conjecture as\nPage 7\nSolano County\n\nApril 8, 2025\nBoard of Supervisors\nMinutes - Final\nto what is going to occur in that site, and are then able to speak to their support or\nnon support for a proposal of this type. Chair Mashburn further noted this will\nprovide members of the public with information and the ability to provide their\ninput as well. Chair Mashburn further stated for the public\u2019s information he wants\nto make two things clear, the first being that the current General Plan may allow\nfor projects similar to what is being dicussed, and the second being that there is\nno other governmental agency that has the jurisdiction to approve a project in\nthat particular region of the County. \nThere was consensus of the Board to bring this item back on April 22, 2025. \nADJOURN:\nThis meeting of the Solano County Board of Supervisors adjourned at 11:07 A.M.\nNext meeting of the Solano County Board of Supervisors will be April, 22, 2025 at\n9:00 A.M., Board Chambers, 675 Texas Street, Fairfield, California.\n________________________________\nMITCH H.

Ms. \nHoward further requested that the Board consider language that includes\n\u201cproduced onsite, offsite on land within Solano County, or in direct partnership,\u201d \nnoting this provides flexibility but will still ensure at least 25% of the product sold\nis grown in Solano County.\nB)\nCliff Howard speaking on behalf of the Solano County Farm Bureau\ncommented on additions to the ordinance related to the onsite growing\nrequirements, noting the Farm Bureau does not agree with the onsite/offsite\ngrowing requirement that does not apply to farm stands larger than 2500 sq. ft.\nMr. Howard further stated it would be difficult for the Farm Bureau to support a\ntext amendment that does require produce or ag products to be grown in Solano\nCounty. Mr. Howard further stated that there needs to be a different definition of\nfarm stands that sell a significant amount of product that is not grown in Solano\nCounty.\nPage 14\nSolano County\n\nApril 22, 2025\nBoard of Supervisors\nMinutes - Final\nC) Gail Culley commented in support of the changes to the farm stand portion of\nthe code and had questions regarding clarification on the potential costs related\nto road maintenance.\nMr. Bezek stated there are no fees related to road maintenance agreements, \nnoting that any project that comes in going forward for subdivisions will need to \nsubmit a proper road maintenance agreement as per the new Road Standards \nand meet the requirements typical for subdivision applications. \nChair Mashburn closed the public hearing. \nSupervisor Williams restated her recommendation to have a countywide Solano \ngrown product percentage requirement of 25% and encouraged the removal of \nexemptions for larger farm stands. Supervisor Williams further recommended \nthat staff utilize subject matter experts when doing updates to the code. \nIn response to a question from Supervisor Vasquez regarding if staff has been \ngiven sufficient direction to clarify the differences in the various farm stands, Mr. \nCalder stated to work in a 25% locally grown number into farm stands over 2,500 \nsquare feet would be acceptable as long as it makes sense for the farmers and \nranchers.\nMr. Bezek commented on the differences between the words local, Solano \ngrown, and regional, noting the Board will need to come to a consensus on a \nterm for staff to craft language for the ordinance. \nMr. Bezek commented on the need for more work with regard to Section IV of the \nproposed ordinance, noting that the changes that are being recommended are \nnot under the purview of the public hearing being held at this meeting. \nChair Mashburn commented on the need to add language to the ordinance \nregarding regionalism, recommending the addition of the language \u201cin partnership \nwith\u201d, to reflect those growers that may grow product in a neighboring county \nwhile working with a Solano County grower, or a farmer from Solano County who \nleases land in a neighboring county because the particular crop they desire to \ngrow, can not be produced in Solano County. \nChair Mashburn commented on the need for two different ordinances, stating he \nwould like to see a clear delineation between the definitions of farm stand and \nlocal market.\nSupervisor W",

Supervisor Vasquez further stated from his \nperspective, this issue should be taken up during the the General Plan review. \nPage 18\nSolano County\n\nApril 22, 2025\nBoard of Supervisors\nMinutes - Final\nJ) Former Supervisor Duane Kromm commented on the need for the public to\nhear data points related to the depth of the shipping channels in the Collinsville\narea and information regarding how much dredging will be required to\naccommodate the type of ships they are planning to build.\nSupervisor Vasquez stated the first step in this process should be a countywide \nsummit, so the cities can state what their future development plans are for the \nnext 10-20 years, noting that at some point, this discussion needs to be heard by \nthe Board and the public. Supervisor Vasquez further stated that at this time, this \nis no pending application for a project. \nSupervisor Williams commented in support of Supervisor Vasquez\u2019s comments, \nnoting she would like more information on potential funding for any projects. \nSupervisor Williams further commented on the need for California Forever to \nwork with the county on any potential proposal. Supervisor Williams further stated \nthe county should be working with Congressman Garamendi, who is focused \nmore heavily on Mare Island, and further noted that she would like the cities to \nallow the county to work through this process. \nSupervisor Brown commented on the need for everyone to wait and see how this \nsituation pans out, noting that the Executive Order does not have funding \nattached to it. \nSupervisor James commented on the need to distinguish the difference between \nthe Ships Act and the Executive Order.\nIn response to Supervisor James\u2019s comments, Mr. Bezek stated the Executive \nOrder identified goals to bring back maritime opportunities that can align with the \nCollinsville area and the General Plan. Mr. Bezek further stated that there has \nbeen no analysis as to what that could mean to Solano County because there \nhas not been a project brought forward. Mr. Bezek further stated the Ships Act is \na bipartisan effort that is still in process with goals that are similar to the \nExecutive Order but more focused at the national level. Mr. Bezek further stated \nthat California Forever has held virtual town halls to describe what they would like \nto see in the Collinsville area, which created a lot of excitement within the cities \nand the media. \nChair Mashburn stated the County has a landowner that has had some \ncontroversy surrounding it and there is stigma attached to that name for good or \nbad. Chair Mashburn further stated prior to California Forever owning the land it \nwas owned by others, noting that regardless of who owns the land, they will still \nbe required to bring any project forward and go through a specific process with \nmany regulatory agencies to make the project happen. Chair Mashburn noted that \nonce that is complete, they would have to bring the proposal to the county for \nreview. Chair Mashburn further stated that this is a valid use of the land per the \ncounty\u2019s current General Plan. Chair Mashburn further stated he fully supports \nthe concept of there being some type of shipbuilding industry or manufacturing \nbrought to the Solano County region; however, there is a need to separate the \nPage 19\nSolano County\n\nApril 22, 2025\nBoard of Supervisors\nMinutes - Final\nexcitement of the cities over the possibilities from the process,",

Supervisor Williams inquired why \ncomparisons are being made with counties that have significantly smaller \nveterans populations. Supervisor Williams commented on the need for more \ncertified staff to process service requests for the veterans population and their \nfamilies and made a recommendation to create a Deputy Director - Veterans \nServices position to ensure if the Director is not present, all services are still able \nto be processed. \nIn response to Supervisor Williams comments regarding certified staff, Assistant \nCounty Administrator Ian Goldberg stated in addition to the Director of Veterans \nServices, there are two staff members who are currently certified; one employee \nwithin the Veterans Services Department at the County Administration Center \nwho is currently out on leave and one certified employee that is housed at Travis \nAFB. Mr. Goldberg noted there has been significant turnover within Veterans \nServices, and the County Administrator\u2019s Office (CAO) has continued to work to \nfill those positions. Mr. Goldberg further stated staff is working to train and obtain \ncertification for current staff and with the addition of two more positions previously \napproved by the Board, staffing within the department is at the highest it has ever \nbeen. Mr. Goldberg stated the CAO has decided the best course of action at this \ntime is to evaluate overall operations within the department to see where \nimprovements can be made, noting revenues within the department are currently \non the decline. \nMr. Emlen stated there have been issues within the department and the CAO has \nbeen working with the Director to rectify those issues. Mr. Emlen further stated, \ngiven that the department is now fully staffed, the CAO would like time to evaluate \nstaff further and to continue to work with the department to ensure all current staff \nhave received their certifications. \nChair Mashburn commented on the previous service levels of the department, \nnoting under the previous director, staff retention and certifications were not an \nissue. Chair Mashburn further stated the department previously had been able to \nprocess more service applications than any other Veterans Services in the entire \nState. Chair Mashburn further stated a change in departmental leadership led to \nthe current issues within the department and recommended CAO review both \nstaff training and management within Veterans Services.\nSupervisor Williams restated her concern regarding Solano County veterans not \nreceiving needed services, noting she wants to ensure the department is \nreceiving the support it needs. \nSupervisor Vasquez inquired if Supervisor Williams is requesting an additional \nposition or the creation of a position to be filled by current staff. \nPage 3\nSolano County\n\nJune 23, 2025\nBoard of Supervisors\nMinutes - Final\nSupervisor Williams stated she is recommending once there is a review of \ncurrent staffing and certifications staff look at potentially creating a new Deputy \nDirector position to be filled potentially by a current staff member.\nSupervisor \nVasquez \nrecommended \nCAO \ncomplete \nboth \na \ntabletop \nand \nmanagement audit, as well as potentially looking at the possibility of merging the \ndepartment with a larger department that provides similar services such as \nHealth and Social Services. \nChair Mashburn noted there will be no changes to Veterans Services \ndepartmental budget at this time. \nSupervisor Brown recommended a tabletop and management audit for the \nSolano Economic Development Corporation (EDC), noting she has concerns \nregarding if the County is receiving enough benefits from the money that is being \nallocated to the Solano EDC. Supervisor Brown further stated she is not currently \nrecommending changes to the budget; however, she is requesting a review of the \ncost to benefit ratio of services being provided to Solano County.\nChair Mashburn invited members of the public to address the Board on this\nmatter and the following comments were received:\nA)\nDirector of Veterans Services Alfred Sims commented on the need for\nadditional management staff within the department.\nIn",

Mayor Hernandez further stated it is the\nhope of the City of Suisun to collaborate with the County on Suisun\u2019s plans,\nnoting they are simply in the planning stages of studying the land and are not\ncommitted to annexing all 22,000 acres.\nD)\nBob Berman commented in opposition to the proposal of the City of\nSuisun for the annexation and noted concerns over the possibility that the\nCity of Suisun used a sole source provider for the completion of the EIR who\npreviously worked for California Forever.\nE) Jim DeKloe commented in opposition to the proposal of the City of Suisun\nfor the annexation.\nF) Duane Kromm commented in opposition to the proposal of the City of\nSuisun for the annexation.\nG) City of Suisun Vice Mayor Jenalee Dawson commented on the time frame\nfor the project, noting full build-out will not be for 50 to 70 years.\nH) James Berg commented in opposition to the proposal of the City of Suisun\nfor the annexation.\nI) Michelle Chavez commented on the proposed City of Suisun annexation.\nIn response to a question from Supervisor Vasquez regarding the staff \nrecommendation, Mr. Emlen stated the County\u2019s current position is that \nexpansion of this magnitude should be handled through the County\u2019s General \nPlan process.\nIn response to a question from Supervisor Williams regarding if Mr. Prebula \nwas denied a meeting with the CAO to discuss this project, Mr. Emlen stated \nearly in the process he met with both Mr. Prebula and the City Manager for \nRio Vista at which time he told them he felt this should be a County driven \nprocess and that the annexation is inconsistent with the County\u2019s current \nGeneral Plan. Mr. Emlen further stated at that point in time, before having any \nfurther conversations, he felt it was necessary to receive direction from the \nBoard. \nSupervisor Williams voiced concerns that the City of Suisun is getting ahead \nof the County\u2019s jurisdiction, noting she feels the City of Suisun should be \nworking with the County as part of the upcoming General Plan process and \nshe doesn\u2019t want to take away the ability of the citizens to vote on this project. \nSupervisor Williams stated she would like to see more cooperation between \nthe two jurisdictions. Supervisor Williams further stated there is a necessity \nPage 27\nSolano County\n\nJune 24, 2025\nBoard of Supervisors\nMinutes - Final\nfor the County to be willing to help the City of Suisun\nIn response to Supervisor Williams\u2019 comments, Mr. Bezek stated that, as it is \ncurrently written, the citizens will not be voting on this item, noting that should \nthe annexation be approved, the City of Suisun could choose to no longer \nconform to the Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) rules.\nMs. Curry stated that if the annexation is approved, even if the ALUC makes a \ndetermination that the project is inconsistent with the Travis Airport Land Use \nCompatibility Plan as well as the Rio Vista Airport Land Use Compatibility \nPlan, the City of Suisun can override the determination. Ms. Curry further \nstated this happened previously with the Walmart project that was built in the \nCity of Suisun, noting that the ALUC made a determination that the project \nwas inconsistent with the Travis Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan and the \nSuisun City Council did an override stating that regardless of the ALUC\u2019s \ndetermination, the Walmart project was more important to the City of Suisun \nthan the concerns of the ALUC and its impacts on Travis AFB. Ms. Curry \nfurther noted as a result of this, the land use compatibility plan for Travis AFB \nhad to be amended to accommodate the fact that there was an inconsistent \nuse near the end of the runway. Ms. Curry further stated the big picture is one \ncity ",

Ms. Curry further stated the \nFairfield-Suisun Sewer District then refused to move forward with the projects \nuntil a comprehensive study is completed. \nSupervisor Williams, referencing minutes from a previous meeting, pointed \nPage 10\nSolano County\n\nJuly 22, 2025\nBoard of Supervisors\nMinutes - Final\nout stakeholder involvement was supposed to be completed prior to starting \nthe study, stating she will not support the recommended action due to a lack \nof stakeholder participation.\nA lengthy discussion was held regarding stakeholder participation during the \ncomprehensive study. \nChair Mashburn stated staff has no intention of not completing stakeholder \noutreach, noting they simply are planning on doing it as part of the \ncomprehensive study instead of before.\nDiscussion was held regarding the parcels that have already been approved \nfor connection, but are being held up by the Fairfield-Suisun Sewer District \nuntil a comprehensive study has been completed. \nFairfield Suisun Sewer District General Manager Jordan Damerel stated it is \ncurrently illegal for sewer services to be provided to the Suisun Valley \nbecause it goes against the Sewer District Enabling Act, which includes \nsome of the Woodcreek 60 parcels and the 2280 Rockville Road parcel. Mr. \nDamerel further stated the Fairfield-Suisun Sewer District needs to look at \nthese projects holistically instead of bifurcating them to better plan for the \nfuture. \nIn response to a question from Supervisor Brown regarding potential projects \nin District 2, Mr. Damerel stated the Fairfield-Suisun Sewer District is required \nby law to plan for areas that are already identified as part of the Fairfield\u2019s \nsphere of influence which could be annexed in the future. Mr. Damerel further \nstated the areas for today's item have not been designated in a city's sphere \nof influence. Mr. Damerel further stated the Fairfield-Suisun Sewer District \nneeds to have a better understanding of what the County's plan is holistically \nfor sewer service before they can evaluate what legislative options exist to \nchange the Fairfield-Suisun Sewer District boundaries. Mr. Damerel further \nstated the Fairfield-Suisun Sewer District is only asking for a review of the \nareas that are going to funnel into Cordelia so they can ensure their planned \nupgrades will be adequately sized for future development. \nIn response to a question from Supervisor Williams regarding when the \nFairfield-Suisun Sewer District advised the County it would require a \ncomprehensive study, Mr. Damerel stated it was March 2025.\nIn response to Mr. Damerel's comments Supervisor Williams stated there \nwas ample time to begin the process of working with the stakeholders and \nrestated she will be voting no on this item because the stakeholders were not \nmet with ahead of time. \nCounty Administrator Bill Emlen stated after receiving the information from the \nFairfield-Suisun Sewer District staff realized before spending time on this \nissue, it was necessary to return to the Board to receive further direction \nbefore engaging the stakeholders. Mr. Emlen further stated there are many \ndimensions to this issue; however, there is going to be an investment by the \nCounty in this process, so Board direction was necessary.\nPage 11\nSolano County\n\nJuly 22, 2025\nBoard of Supervisors\nMinutes - Final\nChair Mashburn opened the public hearing and invited members of the public \nto address the Board on this matter and the following comments were \nreceived:\nA) Duane Kromm commented in support of delaying the recommended study\nuntil the General Plan process takes place.\nB) Jim Leland commented in support of delaying the recommended study\nuntil the Sustainable Agricultural Lands Conservation (SALC) Infrastructure\nCommittee meets again in September 2025.\nC) Cliff Howard commented in support of delaying the recommended study\nuntil the SALC Infrastructure Committee meets again in September 2025 and\ncommented in support of staff utilizing the Farm Bureau and several other\nstakeholder groups for future outreach.\nD) Lisa Howard stated there are no requests for sewer services in the Suisun\nValley and commented in support of delaying the recommended study until\nthe SALC Infrastructure Committee meets again in September 2025.\nE) Don Hofer commented in support of the County moving forward with the\ncomprehensive review.\nF) Tamara Gerlach commented in opposition to municipal sewer services\nwithin",

Supervisor Brown \nvoiced concerns over the safety of Solano County\u2019s residents, noting the \nordinance adopted by the Board needs to be as tight as it can be. Supervisor \nBrown recommended staff contact Solano County\u2019s State representatives about \nchanging this policy. Supervisor Brown further recommended funding for extra \nhelp for the fire department and other first responders be a part of the conditions \nof approval for future applications. \nIn response to comments made by Supervisor Vasquez regarding the current \nprocess creating a double standard, Mr. Bezek stated that is the balancing act \nstaff is walking in creating a draft ordinance that protects Solano County but is \nnot overly restrictive, noting an overly restrictive ordinance would potentially \nencourage applicants to bypass the County and go to the State for approval of \ntheir project. Mr. Bezek further stated systems built like the one at Moss Landing \nare no longer eligible to be approved, noting the goal of future systems is \nutilizing lessons that were learned from the incident at Moss Landing to keep it \nfrom happening again.\nIn response to a question from Supervisor Vasquez regarding decommissioning \nof a site, Mr. Hagstrom stated the decommissioning process requires applicants \nto provide a financial commitment and a guarantee to completely restore the \nproperty, noting 50% of the financial commitment must be posted by the start of \nfull commercial operation and 100% posted by the 5th year of operations. Mr. \nHagstrom further stated payment can include insurance for bankruptcy in the \nform of a bridge policy and shall include but is not limited to financial assurance \nin the form of a bond, a parent company guarantee or an irrevocable letter of \ncredit. \nIn response to a question from Supervisor Vasquez regarding if the County \nPage 7\nSolano County\n\nAugust 12, 2025\nBoard of Supervisors\nMinutes - Final\nchooses which form of guaranteed payment will be made, Mr. Hagstrom stated \nthe applicant can choose which option to take. \nSupervisor Vasquez commented on the need for a review of the application with \nregard to the decommissioning process, noting it should go before the Debt \nAdvisory Board. \nSupervisor Brown commented on the need to ensure that there is no burden on \nthe County for the provision of safety equipment and safety training, noting it \nneeds to be required that they pay for these items prior to beginning a project \nincluding the bond for decommissioning. Supervisor Brown commented on the \nneed to keep the BESS facilities away from schools. \nIn response to comments from Supervisor Brown, Mr. Bezek stated the \nordinance they are crafting does have those requirements within it. Mr. Bezek \nfurther stated staff has consulted with the fire district and other first responders \nto obtain a list of concerns and requirements. Mr. Bezek further stated staff has \nconveyed that information to the California Energy Commission (CEC), with a \ngoal to roll the requirements into what the CEC approves as well.

Mr. Emlen further stated staff \nhas concerns that a reconfigure of the footprint might result in a net reduction \nin agriculture which would be a significant issue with the concept that is now \nout there. \nMr. Bezek provided an overview of County Staff Communication of the \nlegislative language, noting that staff has stated that the mandate should be \ntransparent and should clearly state that it will require an override of Measure \nT. Mr. Bezek further stated staff remains committed to staying within the 2008\nGeneral Plan and EIR and that any new or expanded uses must be \nconsidered through General Plan updates or voter initiatives within the \nlegislation\u2019s timeframe.

Ms. Lange noted that being attached to a budget trailer bill has the \nadded benefit for the proponents of the legislation being adopted immediately \nwithout the 2/3 vote threshold, noting that both Assemblywoman Wilson and \nSenator Cabaldon would also have to be ok with the bill before it being put \nforward.\nSupervisor Williams commented in opposition to voting on legislation she has \nnot had time to read.\nMr. Emlen stated when in discussions with everyone, staff made it clear that it \nhad to be reviewed by the Board before any official position by the County is \nmade.\nSupervisor Brown commented in opposition to the speed in which the \nlegislation is being pushed through, asking what is the impetus that requires a \nvote now. Supervisor Brown further stated she doesn\u2019t understand why Mare \nIsland is not being considered, noting infrastructure and roads are not a \nconcern with Mare Island. Supervisor Brown further stated at this time she \nhas too many concerns to support this legislation.\nIn response to Supervisor Brown\u2019s comments on why this is being pushed \nthrough now, Mr. Bezek stated staff has actively been working with GO-Biz \nwhich is the State\u2019s economic development arm, and California Forever on a \nresponse to a request for proposals which was going through the process, on \nan actual timeline that contained the County\u2019s requirements for CEQA review \nand rezones. Mr. Bezek further stated while staff was submitting what the \nCounty could do to streamline the process, GO-Biz was also working with the \nsite selector. Mr. Bezek further stated GO-Biz alerted staff the site selection \ntimeline had been ramped up most likely in response to some federal funding \nthat has become available. Mr. Bezek further stated, the site selection \ntimeline was moved up to early 2026, which will not allow for the normal \ntimeline that includes CEQA review. Mr. Bezek further stated the timeliness of \nthe legislation is a direct result of the increased timeline to be responsive to \nthe RFP.\nSupervisor Brown commented on concerns over the extensive infrastructure \nthat will need to be built for the Collinsville area vs. using Mare Island. \nIn response to Supervisor Brown\u2019s comments, Mr. Bezek stated GO-Biz has \ndecided the Collinsville area is the most responsive property to what they are \nPage 10\nSolano County\n\nSeptember 9, 2025\nBoard of Supervisors\nMinutes - Final\nhoping to build in the timeframe they are wanting. \nA discussion period was held.\nMr. Emlen stated the only reason staff was willing to engage in conversations \non this legislation is because the area is designated in the General Plan for \nthis type of development. \nA discussion period was held. \nSupervisor Brown commented on concerns over the impacts of potential \ndevelopment in the Collinsville area including saltwater incursion. \nSupervisor \nWilliams \ncommented \nthat \nshe \nbelieves \nshipbuilding \ncan \nbe \nbeneficial to Solano County, noting however she is not in favor of overriding \nMeasure T. \nIn response to a question from Supervisor Williams regarding why there \nwould need to be an override of Measure T if they are staying in the area that \nis already designated, Mr. Emlen stated it is because the current plan would \nchange the boundaries and shape of the area that is designated.\nSupervisor Williams stated she wants assurance that the eastern part of the \nCounty is ok, noting she is concerned about flooding and saltwater incursion. \nA discussion period was held. \nChair Mashburn provided an overview of the timeline in which staff has been \nworking.

Mr. \nSarsour further stated he is aware that NACo representatives will be on \nCapital Hill and will be discussing FEMA reimbursement issues. \nMr. Joseph confirmed that HUD Housing Vouchers are fully funded through \nNovember.

In response to \nSupervisor William's comments Ms. Lange stated under number one on the \nCounty's Health and Social Services platform, equity in health care is \naddressed, noting if the Board is comfortable, items dealing with this topic \ncould be placed under this portion of the platform. \nChair Mashburn invited members of the public to address the Board on this \nmatter.

Supervisor Williams \ncommented on a letter received by an attorney regarding potential legal \nchallenges and requested staff provide more information on that issue. \nSupervisor \nWilliams \nvoiced \nconcerns \nthat \nfollowing \nthrough \non \nthe \nrecommended \naction \nmight \nsend \na \nnegative \nmessage \nto \nthe \ncities \nundermining trust and collaboration.\nIn response to Supervisor Williams comments, Ms. Curry stated under Health \nand Safety Code \u00a7 1797.200, the Board has the authority to designate any \nentity including the current SEMSC, the Public Health Department, or even a \nnew joint agency with another county as the local EMS agency. Ms. Curry \nnoted that the discussion was prompted by the timing of the current Request \nfor Proposals (RFP) and the potential for a member agency of the Joint \nPowers Authority (JPA) to be awarded the contract. Ms. Curry further stated \nany change in the delegation of the authority of the LEMSA would be more \nfeasible prior to the RFP contract being awarded. Ms. Curry further stated \nallowing the RFP process to continue, while still making the Board the \nassuming contracting authority will be easier if that is what the Board desires \nto do.\nIn response to concerns voiced by Supervisor Williams, Supervisor Vasquez \nstated the Board that created the SEMSC did so because Board members \nwere only part time, and the Board at that time didn\u2019t have the desire to take \non yet one more committee. Supervisor Vasquez commented in support of \nthe authority being placed back into the hands of elected officials. \nChair Mashburn stated his reasons for requesting this item be brought before \nthe Board for consideration is because the current structure places authority \nin the hands of individuals who are not elected or directly accountable to the \npublic, noting that State law identifies the County as the ones responsible for \nthese functions. Chair Mashburn further stated that while the individuals \ncurrently serving on the SEMSC have valuable expertise, he would prefer for \nthem to be working in an advisory capacity, keeping the decision-making \nauthority with the Board. \nSupervisor Brown commented in favor of Supervisor Vasquez\u2019s and Chair \nMashburn\u2019s statements regarding changing the current structure to place the \nauthority back into the hands of elected officials that are accountable to the \npublic for their decisions. \nChair Mashburn invited members of the public to address the Board on this\nmatter and the following comments were received:\nA) City of Fairfield Fire Chief John Sturdee stated his main concern is that the\nPage 12\nSolano County\n\nOctober 28, 2025\nBoard of Supervisors\nMinutes - Final\nRFP process continue to move forward. Mr. Sturdee further stated the City of\nFairfield did reach out to the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) and\nwere told by them there was no potential conflict of interest. \nB)\nJames Piersen commented in opposition to the recommended action\nstating the staff report inaccurately characterized Medic\u2019s role in the RFP\nprocess. Mr. Pierson further stated that concerns over a potential conflict of\ninterest had already been reviewed by the FPPC and the State Attorney\nGeneral and no conflict was discovered. Mr. Pierson requested the Board\ndelay any decision until the RFP process had completed.\nC)\nAndrew Schouten commented in opposition to the recommended action\nstating the current RPF is already underway and action by the Board could\ndisrupt the process and undermine a lawful, ongoing procedure.\nMs. Curry stated that while the discussion has centered on the RFP, the \nbroader concern is the structure and governance of the LEMSA. Ms. Curry \nstated she has reviewed prior FPPC opinions and found no legal conflict for \nfire chiefs voting on contracts under public-private partnerships but noted a \nmore recent situation involving the City of Fairfield\u2019s participation in a joint \npowers agreement raised potential perceptions of conflict since Fairfield \ncould benefit from higher Medi-Cal reimbursement rates as a public provider. \nMs. Curry further stated it is important that it be a transparent and fair \nprocess, noting the RFP should continue while staff consults with the State \nEmergency Medical Services Authority and bring back options for possible \ngovernance adjustments.\nPublic Health Officer Dr. Bela Matyas stated that while the discussion is \ncomplex, the issues can be simplified into three key points. Dr. Matyas further \nstated that first, the current composition of the SEMSC does not create a \nfunctional conflict of interest since recusals have occurred in the past without \ndisrupting decision-making; second that since 1996, the SEMSC structure \nhas produced one of the best-performing EMS systems in the State, with \nexcellent \nresponse \ntimes, \ncollaboration \nbetween \nfire \nand \nambulance \nproviders, and efficient hospital handoff; and finally that the central question is \nwhether the Board of Supervisors wishes to assume direct oversigh",

Supervisor Brown also requested updates on prior Board directives\nrelated to the Fairfield-Suisun Sewer District Study and questioned the use of\nstaff time for the community town hall meetings.\nSupervisor Williams stated the town hall meeting was a public event, had \nbeen widely announced, and was for community engagement in her district. \nSupervisor Williams stated she announced the meeting in her newsletter \nwhich she knows is distributed to every Board member. \nChair Mashburn stated when one Board member is dealing with an entity that \nrepresents the entire Board, there needs to be communication and \ncoordination regarding external agencies or staff resources that are involved \nin individual Board member events. Chair Mashburn noted that this is a policy \nwithin the Board rules that Board approval is required when staff is going to be \nexpected to attend an event.\nSupervisor Williams requested clearer policies be developed to ensure \ntransparency regarding event coordination and the use of County staff time. \nSupervisor James confirmed that she had previously informed the Board of \nher intention to invite CSAC to the County. Supervisor James commented in \nsupport of Supervisor William's comments regarding clearer policies. \nCounty Administrator Ian Goldberg stated that staff will return with an update \nfrom the Rules subcommittee, for Board review, including current and \nproposed policies. Mr. Goldberg added that future Board or district events \nrequiring staff participation will be agendized by the full Board, noting that staff \nwill provide estimates time, cost, and if there are any potential scheduling \nconflicts.",

Mr. Quinn further stated they have made several modifications \nto the loan program including implementing a temporary payment deferral \nprocess when appropriate, limiting loans to one borrower or entity controlled \nby \na \nborrower, \nand \nmoving \n$141,000 from \nadministration \ncosts \ninto \nadditional loans. \nMr. Quinn further stated they are making the following recommendations for \nthe Revolving Loan Fund Successor Agreement: 1) reduce the maximum \nloan size from $125,000 to $75,000, 2) increase the monthly servicing fee \npaid to the lenders from $55 to $65, 3) increase the interest rate on the loans \nfrom 6% to 7%, 4) businesses must be located in Solano County and be in \noperation for two years, 5) limit one loan per borrower, 6) allow seasonal \ndeferments, 7) administrative costs (staff time and lender fees) will be no \nmore than 10% of the loan pool and will be paid from interest and if needed \nreturned principal, and 8) the EDC will report quarterly to County on loan \napplications received, loans approved, payments made, administrative costs, \netc.\nMs. Richards stated although a 10% cap is being recommended for the \nsuccessor agreement she wanted to make the Board aware that the EDC \nhas consistently operated this program efficiently with low administrative \ncosts attempting to keep them around 5% including lender fees. \nPage 6\nSolano County\n\nNovember 18, 2025\nBoard of Supervisors\nMinutes - Final\nIn response to a question from Supervisor Brown regarding if the County will \nreceive a summary tracking the loan recipient\u2019s success following repayment \nof the loan, Mr. Quinn stated the EDC does follow up and have made \nrecommendations for them to work with the Small Business Development \nCenter. \nA brief discussion was held regarding the City of Vallejo\u2019s contribution to the \nRevolving Loan Fund program with Mr. Quinn stating that the City of Vallejo \nhad \nset \ntheir \nown \nrequirements, \nwhich \ndoes \nnot \ninclude \neligibility \nfor \nnon-profits to apply. Ms. Richards added any of Vallejo\u2019s ARPA funds that \nwere \nallocated \nfor \nthis \nprogram \nbut \nwere \nnot \nutilized \nwould \nbe \nthe \nresponsibility of the City of Vallejo to pay back. \nIn response to a question from Supervisor Williams regarding if the funds \nthat have been repaid to the program are still under ARPA guidelines, Ms. \nRichards stated the funds that are repaid are now considered general fund \ndollars and they no longer follow ARPA Guidelines. \nIn response to a question from Supervisor Williams regarding if there is a \npossibility to lower the requirement for businesses applying for a loan to \nhave been operating for two years to one year, Mr. Quinn stated after \nspeaking with the various lenders, it was decided that the two year operating \nrequirement ensures there is a proven track record of success for the \nbusiness. \nIn response to a question from Chair Mashburn regarding if there is a firewall \nbetween \nthe \nCounty\u2019s \nRevolving \nLoan \nFund \nand \nthe \nCity \nof \nVallejo\u2019s \nRevolving Loan Fund, Mr. Quinn stated the EDC is the firewall between the \ntwo, noting that the EDC does not commingle the funds and each program \nhas separate policies. \nThe Board directed staff to incorporate the following into the Successor \nAgreement for the Revolving Loan Fund program: 1) reduce the maximum loan \nsize from $125,000 to $75,000 to provide loans to more businesses; 2) increase \nthe monthly servicing fee paid to the lenders from $55 to $65; 3) increase the \ninterest rate on the loans from 6% to 7%; 4) require businesses to be located in \nSolano County and be in operation for two years; 5) retain direction that there \nbe only one loan per borrower or entities controlled by borrower to be \napproved at a time; 6) retain direction that loans may be deferred for seasonal \nbusinesses; and 7) administrative costs, including EDC staff time and lender \nfees do not exceed 10% of the total funds in the loan pool per fiscal year; and \n8) require the EDC to report to the County quarterly on key metrics, including\nbut not limited to loan applications received, loans approved, payments made\nby borrowers, and administrative costs.\nPage 7\nSolano County\n\nNovember 18, 2025\nBoard of Supervisors\nMinutes - Final\n17",

Mr. Gammon further stated should the County adopt the ordinance \nprior to awarding the RFP the County would need to submit an addendum to \nthe State. Mr. Gammon further stated should the ordinance be adopted after \nthe RFP is awarded, the County would have to submit to the State an \naddendum with the executed agreement. Mr. Gammon further stated the \nonly other additional requirement is a minor update to the recently approved \nEmergency \nMedical \nService \nPlan, \nnoting \nthat \noverall \nadoption \nof \nthe \nordinance requires only small administrative addendums and has no impact \non the RFP.\nMs. Curry further stated should the Board approve the introduction of the \nordinance, it will return on December 2, 2025, for adoption and would be \neffective 30 days later. Ms. Curry noted this would then require staff to \nsubmit to the RFP community an addendum notifying them of the change in \nauthority.\nChair Mashburn invited members of the public to address the Board on this\nmatter and the following comments were received:\nA)\nHelen Pierson commented on the differences between the red-lined\nversion of the ordinance and the section of the Code that was supplied in the\npacket. Ms. Pierson commented in support of adjusting the timing of the\nadoption of the ordinance so that the RFP process can be completed with no\npotential for disruption and also alleviate the need for the County to issue a\naddendum. Ms. Pierson recommended refining the language surrounding all\nmedical service levels including Basic Life Support, Advanced Live Support\nand Critical Care Life Support.\nIn response to a question from Supervisor Williams regarding if adoption of \nthe ordinance will cause a disruption in the RFP process due to the need to \nfile an addendum, Mr. Gammon stated if adopted before the execution of the \nagreement, the County must file an addendum and if adopted after the \ncontract is awarded, the County will need to file an amendment with the \nexecuted agreement. Additionally, Ms. Curry stated the process is the same \nPage 8\nSolano County\n\nNovember 18, 2025\nBoard of Supervisors\nMinutes - Final\nif the ordinance is adopted prior to or after the execution of the agreement, \nas an addendum or amendment is simply a notice to the public, with the \ntiming and the document title being the only differences per State guidance. \nMs. Curry noted that the Board could adjust the ordinance's effective date \nshould it choose to move forward today but want to ensure it does not \nbecome effective prior to execution of the agreement.\nSupervisor Williams commented in favor of introducing the ordinance, but \nextending the date of when the ordinance goes into effect. \nIn \nresponse \nto \ncomments \nmade \nby \nMs. \nPierson, \nMs. \nCurry \nprovided \nclarification on the ordinance revisions, noting that the packet included both \nthe ordinance and a red-lined version of the chapter showing only the \nproposed changes. Ms. Curry further stated sections 10,11,14,16, and 17 \nremain unchanged with minor updates limited to sections 12,13, and 15, \nincluding a small wording change from \"welfare\" to \"social services.\" Ms. \nCurry noted that concerns raised regarding section 7.1-13c reflect existing \nordinance language, and the Board could choose to make additions in the \nfuture regarding the incorporation of language surrounding the type of life \nsupport being offered; however it was not part of the prior direction that was \nprovided by the Board. Ms. Curry further stated the intent of this update was \nto streamline the transition of the ordinance to align with the County's \ndesignation of the County's Public Health Department as the new LEMSA.\nB) Michael Coan inquired how bidders would acknowledge an addendum if\nthe bidders have already submitted their RFP.\nIn \nresponse \nto \nMr. \nCoan's \nquestion, \nMs. \nCurry \nstated \nno \nbidder \nacknowledgement is required for the addendum, as proposals have already \nbeen submitted. Ms. Curry further stated the addendum is simply a public \nnotice, and since contract terms remain unchanged aside from the LEMSA \ndesignation, no further action will be necessary.\nSupervisor Vasquez made a motion to approve the staff recommended \naction.\nSupervisor \nWilliams \nmade \nan \nalternate \nmotion \nto \napprove \nstaff \nrecommendation modified to delay the operative date of the ordinance. \nSupervisor James seconded the alternate motion. The motion failed on a \nvote 2-3 with Supervisors Brown, Vasquez, and Chair Mashburn voting no.\nOn motion of Supervisor Vasquez, seconded by Supervisor Brown, the Board \napproved the introduction of an ordinance amending Chapter 7.1 of the Solano \nCounty Code relating to the Local Emergency Medical Services Agency by title \nonly and waived further reading by a majority vote. So ordered by a 3-2 vote \nwith Supervisor James and Supervisor Williams voting no.\nPage 9\nSolano County\n\nNovember 18, 2025\nBoard of Supervisors\nMinutes - Final\n18",

Ms. Jones further stated a court order on \nNovember 6, 2025 resulted in full benefits being distributed to all active \nparticipants on November 7-10, 2025. Ms. Jones noted under the signed \ncontinuing resolution, SNAP benefits will continue in full through September \n30, 2026, with contingent reserves extending coverage through the end of \nOctober 2026. \nIn response to a question from Supervisor Williams regarding how the \nCounty should be moving forward to help its constituents that are facing food \ninsecurity as a result of inflation, Ms. Jones stated the County's role is limited \nto administering state and federal benefits, but staff does support clients by \nproviding information on local resources, including food banks and resource \ncalendars for each city in Solano County.\nSupervisor Williams commented on the ways in which the food bank sources \nfood to be distributed and on the steps other Bay Area counties are taking to \ninvest funding into their food banks. Supervisor Williams requested the \nBoard consider having staff return with a presentation and discussion on how \nSolano County can help the most vulnerable populations that are in need. \nChair Mashburn invited members of the public to address the Board on this \nmatter and the following comments were received:\nA) Orlando Graham commented on food insecurity needs in the community\nand on the increase in demand.\nB) Bryan Espinoza commented on food insecurity needs in the community\nand on the potential upcoming impacts of the changes of HR1.\nC) Kim Castaneda commented on the Food Bank of Contra Costa and\nSolano's (Food Bank) food sourcing and distribution, noting that the Food\nBank does source and purchase food outside of what the USDA and the\nEmergency Food Assistance Food Program (TFAP) provides including both\noutside food donations and cooperative purchasing. Ms. Castaneda further\nstated this allows the Food Bank to provide food that is culturally relevant\nand actually meet the needs of the communities. Ms. Castaneda further\nnoted that there is a continued increase in need for help and encouraged the\nBoard to consider what actions it can take to help with food insecurity in the\nPage 10\nSolano County\n\nNovember 18, 2025\nBoard of Supervisors\nMinutes - Final\ncommunities.\nSupervisor Williams reiterated her request for the Board to consider placing \nan item dealing with food insecurity on a future agenda. \nChair Mashburn stated he agrees with Supervisor Williams request to revisit \nthis item, but stressed the importance of not simply focusing on food \ninsecurity, noting the County will also need to address the upcoming budget \ndeficit for the County's public health clinics and a significant issue with \nhomelessness. Chair Mashburn noted Solano County has a limited tax \ngenerating capacity unlike other Bay Area counties. Chair Mashburn \nrequested that staff return with a report on the vulnerabilities faced by the \nCounty on these issues so the Board can make a reasonable decision on \nwhat to do with its limited reserves and how it will be able to replenish those \nreserves ahead of the next financial crisis. \nSupervisor Williams commented in support of Chair Mashburn's \nrecommended addition to her request and stated the County needs to build a \ncoalition of County leaders. Supervisor Williams further stated she still \nbelieves hunger should be the first item to be discussed. \nD) Elsa Flores commented on the increase in physicians and medical\nworkers encountering patients that are expressing food insecurity and on the\nfuture impacts of HR 1 to health care.\nE) Julia Hahn commented on food insecurity in the County and the need for\nthe County to have a plan to help.\nSupervisor James noted there are 55,000 individuals who are on some form \nof public assistance and many of those are suffering from food insecurity. \nSupervisor James commented in support of a coalition of community leaders \nand ensuring that the County is not being reactive but is taking a proactive \napproach to strategies to ensure it is meeting the residents needs before \ncrisis levels are reached. \nChair Mashburn asked staff to explore whether the County could establish a \nprogram allowing individuals to meet HR 1 work compliance requirements \nthrough volunteer hours, ensuring the approach is legally sound and does \nnot jeopardize federal funding. \nCounty Administrator Ian Goldberg stated staff will return to the Board with \nthe requested information as soon as possible, noting that completion may \nbe delayed due to the holiday season. Mr. Goldberg noted staff is already \nexploring the use of the County's Volunteer program to meet the 80-hour HR \n1 Work mandate. Mr. Goldberg further highlighted areas in which the County \nhas proactively addressed food insecurity by allocating ARPA funds to the \nFood Bank and other nonprofit entities. \nBy consensus of the Board, staff was directed to return to the Board with a \npresentation on potential County vulnerabilities regarding food insecurity, \nhomelessness, and budget deficits related to the County health clinics.\nPage 11\nSolano County\n\nNovember 18, 2025\nBoard of Supervisors\nMinutes - Final\nITEMS FROM THE PUBLIC con't\nThere were no additional comments from the public. \nBOARD MEMBER COMMENTS AND REPORTS ON MEETINGS\nChair Mashburn invited members of the Board to make comments or reports \non meetings.

Supervisor James \nfurther stated she appreciates that even though District \n1 is considered \nurban, staff still has reached out to look at creatively including District 1. \nSupervisor James noted there is a need for a countywide \u201cone Solano\u201d \napproach \nthat \nconnects \neconomic \ndevelopment, \nOne \nWater, \nand \nurban \nareas, particularly given then fact that District 1 has limited unincorporated \nPage 19\nSolano County\n\nDecember 9, 2025\nBoard of Supervisors\nMinutes - Final\nlands. \nSupervisor \nVasquez \ncommented \nthat \nfor \nSolano \nCounty, \neconomic \ndevelopment is fundamentally about increasing County revenues, noting that \nwhile agriculture is vital to Solano County, it generates limited tax revenue. \nSupervisor Vasquez further stated the County collects limited sales tax \noverall and there has long been a need for additional revenue to fund \nservices, employee obligations and community needs. Supervisor Vasquez \ncommented on distinguishing between economic development that grows the \neconomy and strategies that directly increase county revenues. \nIn response to Board Member comments Mr. Bezek stated the department\u2019s \ngoal was to make the Board aware that revenue growth requires future \ndiscussions about land use or other revenue mechanisms with municipal \nservices and utilities being identified as key limitations on revenue generating \ndevelopment. \nChair Mashburn stated that while he agrees decisions do not need to be \nmade at today\u2019s meeting, there are several projects that will be completed in \nearly 2026 including the SALC Grant, the One Water Framework, and the I-80 \nCorridor Study which will all feed in into the upcoming General Plan, making \nthe need to hire a consultant quickly a priority. Chair Mashburn commented \non the tight timeline, noting it is important to begin compiling data and reports \nnow so that the General Plan update can proceed efficiently once a \nconsultant is on board.\nDiscussion was held regarding the \n2008 General Plan timeline and the \ntimeline that is planned for the \n2027 General Plan update. Mr. Calder \ncommented on potential options to provide greater flexibility with Williamson \nAct properties.\nIn response to Mr. Calder\u2019s comments, Chair Mashburn stated staff needs to \ntake a holistic look at agricultural protections. Chair Mashburn stated the \nCounty needs to consider hiring an economic development advisor who has \nexpertise on this subject. \nIn \nresponse \nto \nChair \nMashburn\u2019s \nc",
