      "text": "Solano County ReGIS Meeting \nMeeting Minutes \u2013 June 16, 2021 \n \nShital called to order the regular meeting at 9:06 am on June 16, 2021 via Zoom. \nI. \nIntroductions \nThe following persons were present: Shital Dhakal, Stewart Bruce, Nellie Dimalanta, Donald \nHildebrandt, Curt Corbett, Jasmin Acuna, Bao Nguyen, Becki Brooks, Brent Rosenwald, Alex Lacson, \nMark Unwin, Rosaly Zambrana, Stephanie Baker, Justin Pascual, Rowland Roberts, Kathrina Gregana. \nII. \nApproval of Meeting Minutes and New Business \nA. No questions nor comments were brought up for the May 19 meeting minutes and was accepted by \nthe group. \nB. New Business: \n1. Shital: \na. Upcoming changes posted on the Federal Register website pertaining to NAD83 and \nNAVD88 national standards for geodetic coordinates. The modernization of the \nNational Spatial Reference System will replace the current standards with four new \nframes and one new datum. Change will occur between 2022 and 2025. NOTE: \nSanborn aerial imagery will be submitted in CA State Plane WGS 1984. \nb. Vexcel Imaging is an aerial imaging company that provides free imagery for areas \nclaimed as a disaster zone. It is not necessary to be under contract with them. \nBecki asked if Pictometry provided free imagery with all the fires in the area last \nyear, per Jasmin they did not provide the service because it wasn\u2019t covered in the \ncontract. Under Sanborn\u2019s contract, they also only provide free service if a disaster \nwas due to specific occurrences - tornado, hurricane, earthquake 7.0 or greater, or \nterrorist/man-made attack, fire is NOT covered. \n2. Curt asked if other agencies use Metroscan Corelogic, a software specializing in parcel data, \nresidential, commercial, industrial and vacant property, wherein one of their tools is a \nmultiple mailer solutions. Vacaville has had requests of historical data for parcels but were \nredirected to the County because their (Vacaville) data is not always current. They also have \ndeveloped a public notification mailer tool on AGOL where employees have their embedded \nlogin credentials so login is instantaneous. It also has the capability to export to an excel \nspreadsheet, send mailers to the situs address and/or owner address. Most of their users \nare in public works and community development, about 50-60 accounts. \na. No other agency is using Metroscan. \nb. Solano County preserves parcel data at the end of the year. They will not provide \ntransfer dates, telephone numbers in their GIS data. \nc. Fairfield hasn\u2019t used Metroscan in a while and uses current assessee owner \ninformation. \nd. Shital has used ParcelQuest in the past, data update is every 6 months, data \nsimplified in a user-friendly interface. They have a widget to print out their own \n\nSolano County ReGIS Meeting Minutes \u2013 June 16, 2021 \n \n2 of 3 \n \nmailing labels. Metroscan provides archived data of previous parcel ownership and \ntransfer data. \n3. Jasmin \u2013 Fairfield is working with MTC for emergency evacuation planning maps, provided \nbuilding outlines and street centerlines using the County GIS hub. MTC in turn has provided \ndata to FF. No other agency has received data from MTC. Vacaville has preset evacuation \nroutes for high threat evacuation boundaries, no knowledge of MTC providing data to them. \nJasmin will forward data to the group. Nellie asked how MTC data compares with PG&E \nemergency routes but Jasmin has not compared the data yet. STA is not familiar with \nemergency routes but will find out. Nellie to provide Jasmin and the group a link to PG&E \nPSPS portal page and other information from PG&E. \n4. Stew \u2013 Solano County GIS websites will be consolidated, re-configured and completely \nrevamped by July, including the SharePoint page ReGIS members were using. They\u2019re \nworking with a webposting company to assist with this project. \nIII. Discussion \nA. Workgroup Updates: \n1. Aerial Imagery (Stew) \u2013 QA/QC this July. Sanborn\u2019s Project Status report was forwarded to \nReGIS members. Any questions or comments should be forwarded to him. See attached \nslideshow. \na. Looking into a 6-year contract, 2022 to 2027 - 3\u201d res 4-band Near IR imagery with \nurban areas and sphere of influence. County to be divided into 3 unincorporated \nsections and captured triennially. Ability to access obliques on any apps. SASS \nsolution is required. Meet all technical requirements for accuracy. Leaf-off flights. \nb. Planimetric data this year will encompass building outlines, edge of pavement, \nparking lots/runways/tarmacs. Will continue to capture planimetrics for \nunincorporated areas flown and in urban areas updated annually. \nc. In 2 weeks the aerial imagery scope will be presented to the committee for review, \nthen to vendors for proposal, vendor presentation, vendor selection by committee. \nSolano County BOS to approve the 6-year contract. A new County standard E-sign \ncontract will be distributed for all stakeholder agencies to sign. \nd. No cost increase from previous years! \n2. NextGen911 Workgroup Updates (Stew) \u2013 consultant Geocomm maintaining street \ncenterlines, offered extra service to convert existing street centerline data attribution to the \nNextGen911 standard format. \na. $75,000 grant opportunity, where a portion will be allocated towards an enterprise \nsystem, BCS The Addresser tool. Sac County is using this tool and is happy with it. \nThey provide the software, the tool is nonproprietary, runs on top of the ESRI \nenterprise portal is compatible with the County\u2019s Azure website portal. Stew will \narrange for a demo of the BCS The Addressor tool, perhaps around August. \nb. Solano County has taken a different approach from previous NextGen911 \ndiscussions, to outsource the parcel data maintenance to Geographic Technologies \nGroups. There will be two full time staff dedicated solely to 1. street centerlines \nand 2. parcels. Additional plan is to move all street centerlines, address points and \n\nSolano County ReGIS Meeting Minutes \u2013 June 16, 2021 \n \n3 of 3 \n \nLAFCO boundaries to the cloud, to provide a collaboration platform for ReGIS \nagencies. They will have full responsibility for their jurisdictional parcels/address \npoints and street centerlines. \n3. Shital asked if other agencies are using the ESRI parcel fabric\u2026 Stew responds that it is not \non the table at this time, perhaps 1 to 2 years away. Assessor parcels are still an issue, and \ncurrently undergoing a massive cleanup. Until a more precise base layer is produced, they \nwill not be using ESRI\u2019s parcel fabric. \na. Curt mentioned their workflow for parcel generation starts with a DWG file \nconverted to a SHP file to developing vertical data. It is not easy to use parcel fabric \nmainly due to idiosyncrasies of CAD submittals not meeting GIS topology rules. \nb. Curt asked Stew if they are thinking of spearheading CAD standards for parcel \nsubmissions, Stew\u2019s response is that assessor parcels involve deeds, surveyed \n\u201cclosing\u201d geometry and politics it would be a huge blockage to the assessor approval \nand recording processes. So, although Stew\u2019s GIS goal for SC is to move towards \nexcellence, establishing digital GIS standards for parcels is not currently at the \nforefront. \n \nB. Executive Team Updates: \n1. Schedule for in-person ReGIS meetings \u2013 no comment at this meeting. Could be added to \nthe GIS Survey Stew is preparing. \n2. Lightning Talk \u2013 it would be nice to learn more about the awesome GIS work each agency \nhas developed for their daily workload. Looking for volunteers to do a quick 5-minute talk \nabout their projects. Shital has volunteered. Stew is looking into having one of their staff to \nparticipate\u2026 open to all! \n3. Plans to invite other GIS professionals \u2013 potential item on the questionnaire. \n4. GIS Survey \u2013 Stew, in progress. Berkeley may have one. Identify top 5 governance priorities \nfor the group. May use Survey123 for the questionnaire. \nIV. Action Items \n1. Jasmin \u2013 MTC information about emergency routes. \n2. STA \u2013 find out if there was communication with MTC",

No questions nor comments were brought up for the June 16 meeting minutes and was accepted by \nthe group. \nB. New Business: \n1. Shital: RouteSmart \u2013 company based in Maryland for intelligent routing systems. Vallejo is \ninterested in this type of technology for their street sweeping program and potentially other \nprograms. Fairfield has a Street Sweeping webapp that contains preplanned routes and \nzones for street sweeping, search by address and zoom to the zone and schedule. Also uses \nthe same webapp builder for trash collection. Vacaville uses the Recology.com street \nsweeping app similar to the functionality Fairfield\u2019s webapp. \n2. Jasmin: pushback from FFPW with LAFCO city limit layer after their review. Parcel layers in \nGIS is generally digitized and not based on metes and bounds. LAFCO city boundary layer is \nbased on legal descriptions which may pose legal ramifications should there be \nmisalignments with other datasets. Curt spoke with Jeff Lum, LAFCO, there\u2019s pushback from \ntheir public works as well because of misalignments with other jurisdictional datasets such \nas police and sheriff response boundaries, impacting RIMS. The LAFCO layer will not be \npublished on any Vacaville\u2019s public website at this point. Per Stew, LAFCO is the \nauthenticated owner of the boundary layer wherein the Cities need to come into an \nagreement. The County will eventually adopt LAFCO\u2019s dataset for basemaps and other \napplications displaying city boundaries. No parcel nor street centerline adjustments will be \nmade until LAFCO officially \u2018certifies\u2019 the data. Executive director of LAFCO plans to setup a \ndate to meet with Vacaville, Fairfield and Suisun City for review of the previously \ndisseminated city boundary datasets. County GIS is under contract to maintain boundary \nfiles for LAFCO, they\u2019ve already spent approximately 7 months revising boundary files, \naffecting fire, water districts; impacting tax maps. It\u2019s estimated that it will take \napproximately 2 years to adjust these datasets using LAFCO city boundary as the basemap. \n3. Stew \u2013 released a parcel layer in July via WeTransfer. Another update will be in August and \naccessible via the Azure portal, external access with logins. They will also have a REST URL \nfor the parcel approx. Aug-Sep timeframe. The County has a side project with SID to update \nparcels along their utility lines after new aerial imagery is released. \n4. Stew \u2013 looking into Corelogic/RealQuest for parcel data. \n\nSolano County ReGIS Meeting Minutes \u2013 July 21, 2021 \n \n2 of 3 \n \nIII. Discussion \nA. Workgroup Updates: \n1. Aerial Imagery (Stew) \u2013 Monday (July 26 +/-) they will release an RFP for 6-year contract. \nSanborn to present on the oblique viewer. \n2. NextGen911 Workgroup Updates (Stew) \u2013 will hire the same consultant who is currently \nworking on parcels to work on street centerlines and address points, they offered the extra \nservice of converting existing street centerline data attribution to the NextGen911 standard \nformat. \na. $72,000 funding to purchase BCS The Addresser tool. \nb. Interested in RouteSmart for a routable street centerline. The ultimate goal is for \nthe cities to have primary control of their streets within their incorporated area and \nhave one unified dataset for the entire county. With this project, they will work \nclosely with RIMS centers to correlate the data with GIS. Long process but will get it \ndone. \nc. County working with 4 GIS positions, 2 dedicated to parcel data, 2 dedicated to \nstreet centerlines. \n3. \nBridget \u2013 presented Sanborn Oblique Viewer. \na. \nCan Google map be the first image to the extent of Solano County and not the \nimagery? Bridget will find out. \nb. \nEnhance accessibility to the high-res imagery in the box below versus having a \nsmall button in the compass wheel. Bridget says it may not be optional but will look \ninto it. \n \nc. \nDoes the URL button \u2018copy to clipboard\u2019 to street view or imagery? Per Bridget\u2019s \ndemo it defaults to the imagery. She will look more into it. \nd. \nScott (Sanborn) mentioned that certain layers could be defaulted ON with the \nimagery. Asking a consensus on default ON layers. Recommended to be mindful of \nspecific default layers, such as parcels, may be taxing on bandwidth, slowing down \nspeed response. Connecting to a service file or uploading a shapefile may be \nquicker. \ne. \nSearch box on the middle left side searches any loaded attribute data. Searching \nlarge parcel data may not zoom in accurately. Per Stew, parcel centroids can be \ndeveloped to enhance search. Is it possible to multiple search parcels? Bridget will \nlook into this. \nf. \nSanborn will be meeting with TAFB next week to discuss Search functionality and \nother uses of the application specific to their required security protocols. \n\nSolano County ReGIS Meeting Minutes \u2013 July 21, 2021 \n \n3 of 3 \n \n \ng. \nFlight date in upper right corner date of the last group capture, lower left indicates \nwhen the flight imagery was actually captured. \nh. \nSanborn is open to end users preferences to produce a great product for all \nstakeholders. \n \nB. GIS Survey \u2013 should be completed within a week or so. Plans to have one focused on Governance \npriorities, the other to learn other agencies\u2019 GIS projects and needs. \nC. Lightning talk \u2013 postponed for next meeting \u2013 crime mapping, not a live data feed. Jasmin \nvolunteered as the next presenter. \nIV. Action Items \n1. Sanborn to address questions by attendees. \n2. All \u2013 review Sanborn imagery via GeoServe. \n3. Stew to request a demo of BCS Addresser tool. \n4. All - other potential presentations by vendors, consultants, other local public agencies. \n5. All - Lightning Talk volunteers? \n6. STA \u2013 find out if there was communication with MTC about emergency routes. This was a question \nthat Jasmin brought up in the last meeting since they have been sharing data with MTC. \nV. \nAdjournment \nMeeting was adjourned by Shital at 10:00am. Next ReGIS monthly meeting will be 9:00am Aug. 18. \n \n \n",

No questions nor comments were brought up for the July 21 meeting minutes and was accepted by\nthe group.\nB. New Business:\n1.\nSuisun City (Roland): asking if other agencies have contracts with Interwest, their GIS\nconsultant. The company seems to have internal staff restructuring and some have left for\nInfinity Technologies. Vacaville uses Interwest as well and is experiencing the same\npredicament.\nC. Nicole Braddock, Executive Director of Solano Land Trust with Ryan Branciforte - OuterSpatial\npresentation about their countywide parks and recreation project, link to presentation.\n1.\nMap-based mobile app to locate CA State Parks within the community categorized by types\nof activities, similar to the AllTrails app but more. Other data includes parking, trails, PDF\nmaps, parks, restroom facilities, etc. They would also like to provide red flag day warnings,\nso working with local fire agencies and emergency response.\n2.\nSLT is highly encouraging sharing data with them to improve the data for SC and the\ncommunity we serve. Don and Stew are the main contacts, any information that will be\nshared by other cities should funnel through them.\n3.\nSLT uses maps daily and considers ReGIS peeps as \u201cunsung heros\u201d \u09b8\n\u09b9\n\u09ba\n\u09bb\n4.\nPartnering with Kaiser Permanente with Take a Hike Challenge and other companies to get\npeople to engage in outdoor activities.\nA.\nWorkgroup Updates:\n1.\nAerial Imagery (Stew) \u2013 final review Tuesday August 24, moving along well. Sanborn and\nEagleview are vying for the contract. Eagleview has a more user-friendly oblique viewer, but\nSanborn\u2019s quote is more feasible, leaning more towards the latter. Multi-agency agreement\nwill be forwarded to stakeholders soon. NO INCREASE FOR THE NEXT 6 YEARS. Looked into\nmore partners for the contract, however most of the agencies are relatively small and may\nnot monetarily contribute. TAFB may not sign the agreement but has contributed\nfinancially.\n2.\nNextGen911 Workgroup Updates (Stew) \u2013 GeoComm is working on the parcel update, street\ncenterlines and address point layers, unsure if they\u2019ll continue to work with the County after\ntheir contract has ended. SC is working on a countywide address point layer, many thanks\n\nSolano County ReGIS Meeting Minutes \u2013 August 18, 2021 \n \n2 of 2 \n \nand high fives to the cities of Fairfield and Vacaville for sharing their data. \u0735\n\u0736\n\u0737\n\u0738 \u0735\n\u0736\n\u0737\n\u0738 \u0735\n\u0736\n\u0737\n\u0738 Next \nmonth SC plans to roll out an ArcGIS online EOC app. Working on integrating Alert Solano \napp, live feed into SC EOC app. Also integrating fire calls into RIMS, special views for \ndispatch to city partners. \nB. GIS Surveys \u2013 should be completed within a week or so. Plans to have one focused on Governance \npriorities, the other to learn other agencies\u2019 GIS projects and needs (later this year). Goal is to select \nthe top 5 items (out of 20) as ReGIS\u2019 framework. Recommendation is to limit the distribution of the \nquestionnaire to IT/GIS staff. \nC. Datasharing agreement \u2013 SC has one in place but basically says all agencies in the consortium will \nhave access to data, with the exemption to confidential data. Their Azure portal will serve as a one \nstop shop, REST services will also be available. \nIII. Action Items \n1. Stew to request a demo of BCS Addresser tool. \n2. All \u2013 think of potential presentations by vendors, consultants, other local public agencies. \n3. All - Lightning Talk volunteers? Shital, Jasmin, Stew (Digital Twin, metaverse towards the end of the \nyear). \nIV. Adjournment \nMeeting was adjourned by Stew at 10:00am. Next ReGIS monthly meeting will be 9:00am Sep. 15. \n \n \n",

September Meeting Minutes: Jasmin asked about the 6-yr contract for aerial imagery flyover, Stew \nmentioned it will be addressed later in the meeting. No additional comments were brought up, \nmoved for acceptance by Stew and seconded by Shital. \nB. New Business: \n1. Jasmin \u2013 Fairfield has a new IT director, Savita Chaudhary, from the City of Berkeley and \nbefore that an employee of the City of Vacaville who also attended ReGIS meetiongs. One \nof the first endeavors is to generate a GIS Master Plan. \n2. Stew - Solano County Azure cloud is fully functional with ITIL framework. There will be a call \nfor individuals to test out the site soon. Shital requested that the County IT team provide a \npresentation of ITIL framework and was agreeable by Stew. \n3. Shital \u2013 asked if other agencies are using/looking into using Metroscan. Fairfield has used \nMetroscan about 12 years ago, currently receiving parcel tabular data from the County. \nWith inhouse programming mechanisms to run queries to detect inconsistencies with the \ndata, the workflow seems to work for now. Stew mentioned that the County is behind \nabout 9 months with parcel data updates and is working with CoreLogic to assist with \nresolving this issue but this is a huge undertaking and will take some time. \n4. GIS Day \u2013 it is not feasible to conduct an in-person event. Stephanie, ESRI, commented that \nit is quiet this year, but feel free to check out ESRI\u2019s website for virtual events. \n5. Rowland \u2013 looking into a new GIS consultant, Interwest has dissolved. Vacaville is moving \nforward with Infinity Technologies, formerly Interwest.

The Addresser is configured in ArcGIS Portal so data resides in \nArcSDE or ArcGIS datastore but compatible with any platform. Per Stew, the plan is to post \nthis application on the County\u2019s Azure portal so the data will reside in a PostgreSQL DB. \n\nSolano County ReGIS Meeting Minutes \u2013 October 20, 2021 \n \n2 of 3 \n \n\u2022 \nStew anticipates additional presentations in the near future focusing on specific workload \nneeds of stakeholders; i.e. assigning addresses, street naming, end users, et al. The County \nwill fully fund installation of the software. (YAY!) \n\u2022 \nMigration path \u2013 discussion to be tabled for the next meeting and may have a \nsubcommittee involving more IT representation. \n\u2022 \nStew \u2013 looking into a comprehensive budgetary proposal to focus on address points and \nstreet centerlines, integrating with several RIMs DB, and pulling in other multi-jurisdictional \ndepartments to build support to find funding for this endeavor, which is estimated upwards \ntowards half a million dollars. \n \nB. Aerial Imagery (Stew) \u2013 final review of 6-year contract, moving forward with using SanBorn as \nthe vendor/consultant. Multi-agency agreement will be forwarded to stakeholders soon. NO \nINCREASE FOR THE NEXT 6 YEARS. \nIV. Action Items \nA. Datasharing agreement \u2013 as previously discussed, agencies willing to share jurisdictional GIS layers \non the County\u2019s Azure cloud (see initial email from Stew on July 27, 2021) may forward a data \nsharing agreement to Stew for review. \nB. GIS Survey results \u2013 next meeting. \nV. \nAdjournment \nMeeting was adjourned by Stew at 10:00am.

October Meeting Minutes: No additional comments were brought up, moved for acceptance \nby Stew and seconded by Jordan. \nB. No new business. \nIII. Discussion: \nA. Solano County Governance survey results: \n1. Stew \u2013 thanks the group for feedback for the Top 5 priorities which are Data Quality, Data \nArchitecture, Access, Data Stewardship and Performance. \n2. Other governance areas that didn\u2019t make it to the top 5 but just as critical are Strategic \nPlan, Daily Usage, Communications, and Training & Development. \n3. Data quality \u2013 not a surprise as this is at the top of the list for priorities. Parcel data and \naddressing datasets are improving daily on the County side. As members are data \nsharing more with agreements in place, there is an ongoing effort to ensure data is \nmaintained. Stew may send out another survey about agencies\u2019 data quality/needs \nassessment. \n4. County plans to schedule training on the Azure portal for internal County staff and ReGIS \nmembers. \n5. Danny F asked if the data quality pertains to internally and/or externally shared data? \nPer Stew, both\u2026 some stakeholders do not have the capacity to maintain data integrity \nand rely on outside resources such as the County to provide additional services to assist \nwith staying up to speed with their ongoing community growth. The County has pledged \nto help all ReGIS stakeholders as a consortium, to continue to work through these \nchallenges. \nB. Solano County Website \u2013 Daniel. Consolidating to a single index environment for ReGIS \nmembers and the public. December goal to build a skeletal framework in hopes to have \nReGIS members test the site at the beginning of the new year. Stew would like to upload \npast meeting minutes to the new website. \nC. Aerial imagery \u2013 Stew. 6-yr contract, Urban and SOI 3\u201d res annually, planimetrics updated \nannually, Lidar spread out over a couple of years to be captured at high res. Sanborn \n\nSolano County ReGIS Meeting Minutes \u2013 November 17, 2021 \n \n2 of 3 \n \ncontract and MOU will be sent out to all partners at the end of the week, for review by the \npowers-at-hand. If there are no comments, the contract will subsequently be sent out for \nelectronic sigs, with the target date of Jan 4 for Board presentation. Feb/Mar 2022 to start \nflights with the entire county at 3\u201d res, annual data capture for urban core, then every 3rd year \nflying unincorporated areas. \nD. COST SHARING IS THE SAME DOLLAR AMOUNTS FROM PREVIOUS YEARS. \nE. Geocomm \u2013 converted street CL to new NextGen 911 format will make accessible to ReGIS \npartners via the portal. Working on a proposal for funding aimed at improving streets and \naddress point datasets. Working with Vallejo, Vacaville and Fairfield on address changes \ncities are implementing in their jurisdictions. \nF. BCS application \u2013 Stew. Asked feedback about the application. \n1. Jasmin \u2013 FF already has a 3rd party application for its address data, will BCS integrate \nwith 3rd party? Per Stew, goal is for all partners to use BCS and collaboratively share \nthe single countywide dataset, streamlining data updates and minimizing duplicate \nefforts in data development. BCS will be made accessible to all partners, wherein \nthey are responsible for their jurisdictional data. Asking no funds from the cities to \ninvest in the software. Decided to purchase the software with training, hoping by April \n2022 installation. \nG. GIS Day \u2013 Nellie. Virtual events occurring around the globe were listed on ESRI\u2019s website \nbut it\u2019s been more quiet again this year. ESRI may have an in-person conference in 2022 \nH. Shital has moved on leaving the ReGIS Chair position vacant. \u0354\n\u0355\n\u0356 Looking for \nnominations! \u0690\n\u0691\n\u0692 Stew pointed out that the position isn\u2019t limited to primarily GIS folks but \nthose who are more in a managerial/leadership role, wholistically interested in the \ncollaborative goals of ReGIS, to expand and strengthen the consortium and the communities \nthey serve. More discussion at the next meeting. \nI. GIS Membership list \u2013 Nellie, primary contact for each of the agency are listed on the \nagenda. Talk to Daniel about member management system. Proud City to possibly assist \nwith this. \nJ. Lightning Talk volunteer for the next meeting \u2013 Pam Caronongan (?) \nIV. Action Items \nA. Nellie to send Stew\u2019s presentation slides to ReGIS members, forward past meeting minutes \nfor posting on ReGIS website, send out information about Chair. \nV. \nAdjournment \nMeeting was adjourned by Stew at 10:00am. There is no meeting for the month of December. \nNext ReGIS meeting will be January 19, 2022. \n \n \n\nSolano County ReGIS Meeting Minutes \u2013 November 17, 2021 \n \n3 of 3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

Next month will \ncover more governance pertaining to zoning and general planning layers. Data \nstewardship \u2013 work with city partners to tighten parcels and streets, discuss governance.\nB. Solano ReGIS Website \u2013 Daniel. ProudCity vendor for\nwebsite. Framework built with accessibility in mind and\nprevious ReGIS environment.\n1. Fiverr.com was hired to design at least 5 logos to \nchoose from (County is still open to\nsuggestions) but after Daniel conducted an on-the-\nspot poll, most popular\n================================\uf0e8\n2. Consolidating website to a single index environment servicing ReGIS members, County \nstaff, and the public. No separate County GIS website.\n3. ReGIS Partner Directory will have links to agency GIS site or main website and main \ncontact info, please forward URLs.\nC. Aerial imagery \u2013 Stew. 14 sets of hard drives of all Sanborn data deliverables will be sent to \nReGIS partners within 4-6 weeks. Web Mercator technical error in aerial imagery, ESRI \nsoftware issue not Sanborn. Issue will be resolved, will forward documentation later.

NextGen 911 \u2013 County working with Geocomm, updating street CL, address point layer, and\nwill be accessible to ReGIS partners via the portal. Monthly updates to street data. Will move\nforward with the BCS tool, approx. 5 months to go online and made accessible via portal.\nE. Adding users to SC GIS portal, each ReGIS partner will have access to Azure portal with\ntheir own login credentials.\nF. Lightning Talk \u2013 no one scheduled but Donald mentioned he is working with STA and Solano\nLand Trust on a project called Top 10 Walk and Bike Trails in Solano County in collaboration\nwith OuterSpatial, an app similar to AllTrails. Park Depts are data stewards of their\njurisdictions. Information will be on brochures and online, data consists of recreational\namenities and trails. Per STA, soft launch to be expected within the next couple of months,\nmay commit to a lightning talk then.\nCity of Fairfield Parks & Rec is a contributing member of OuterSpatial. Fairfield GIS would\nlike to shine alongside other agency contributors to the project but is encountering hurdles\nobtaining necessary data despite upper management approvals. One suggestion from the\ngroup is to have a timeline of when data is needed, STA is working on a soft launch date\nwhich may help with this effort. Another approach is to develop an internal marketing\nstrategy, perhaps show staff how their data contributions can attract more users to local park\nfacilities, not necessarily just asset management but operational GIS functions.\nSolano Irrigation District \u2013 Bao, working on updating their GIS data, Stew recommended that\nthey do a lightning talk of their GIS to date.\nG. Accepting nominations for the ReGIS chair position, email Stew! Would like fresh eyes to\nhelp steer the consortium, position isn\u2019t limited to primarily GIS folks but those who are more\nin a managerial/leadership role.\nIV.\nAction Items\nA.

An appendix shall be attached to this policy detailing \nwhere these control documents are. Each GIS dataset will have metadata, enabled through the \nappropriate ESRI metadata in both the Portal item description as well as embedded with the actual \ndataset, that shall also provide a short data quality statement. The dataset control document shall \nrecord the history of any data quality improvements identified from the initial data quality review; and \nrecord when these improvements have been accomplished. \nDecision Rights \nThe data steward of each GIS dataset shall have the ultimate right and authority to improve the data \nquality of any dataset shared on the Portal. The Solano County DoIT GIS Team has the right to add a \ndata quality statement to any dataset published on the Portal based on our internal data quality review \nregardless of the data steward. Any data quality issues noted on the dataset shall be shared with the \ndata steward who shall be encouraged to correct them. \nInputs \nThe Solano County DoIT GIS team, or a designated contractor, shall be required to develop the dataset \ncontrol document and perform a data quality analysis with each data delivery. \nActivities \nThese are the specific minimum data quality areas that shall be evaluated, and part of the data quality \ninformation contained in the metadata. \na. Topology \n \nAll polygons and lines shall have their topology validated and a summary report provided. For \npolygons, the topology validation should check for overlapping features and for any gaps in the \ndata. The validation should be done at the default ESRI spatial tolerance. Lines shall also be \nchecked for dangling nodes as well as overlaps. Points shall be analyzed to identify any \nduplicate or multiple points at the same coordinate location. \n\n2 \n \nb. Attributes \n \nA listing of each attribute column heading and what that attribute column means shall be \ncreated and attached with the metadata. If aliases are used, they should be identified. If there \nare coded attributes, then a list of what each code means is also required. An analysis of the \nattributes for inconsistences, such as an attribute that means the same thing being spelled in \ndifferent ways, or individual features that do not have attributes at all shall also be identified. If \nexternal data is joined to the spatial features, then an analysis of any external attributes that do \nnot have a correlated feature shall also be conducted. \n \nThe data quality analysis should also examine the accuracy of external attribute data sources \nthat are joined to the spatial features. \n \nc. Precision, accuracy, and scale \nData shall be evaluated for precision and accuracy. For each dataset the scale at which the data \nwas collected and intended for use at should be clearly identified. For example, planimetric \ndata collected using the county high resolution aerial imagery was not collected at the same \nscale as US EPA hydrology data. Therefore, how each dataset aligns with the county aerial \nimagery shall vary. \nEach dataset control document shall outline in detail how to evaluate for this category. \nThe figure below shows how these may vary with any given dataset, \n \n\n3 \n \nd. Age of data \nThe collection date shall be analyzed and reported. If any dataset is more then one year old, \nthen the dataset control document should address this age issue with plans to refresh the data. \nThe dataset control document shall also document the update frequency. For example, parcels \nare updated every month. \nPerformance Metrics \nPerformance metrics shall be clearly identified in each dataset control document along with the \nprocedure to be used to validate and report these metrics. \n \nRACI \n \nRoles \nChief Technology Officer \nRegional GIS Senior Manager \nGIS Manager \nGIS Analysts \nContractors \nSC Departments \nREGIS Partners \nExternal Data Sources \nTasks \nStatus Sponsor \nProject Team \n \nOther \nResources \nApprove Governance \nPolicy \n \nR \nA \n C \n \n \n \nC, I \n \nDevelop Governance \nPolicy \n \nC \nA, R \nR \n C \n \nC, I \n \nApprove Control \nDocuments \n \n \nR \n \n \n \nI \nI \n \nDevelop Control \nDocuments \n \n \nR \nA, \nR \nR \nR, C \nI \n \n \nConduct Data Quality \nAnalysis \n \n \nI \nA \nR \n \n \n \n \nShare Data Quality \nConcerns \n \n \nC, I \nA \n \n \nI \nI \nI \nData Quality - M",
