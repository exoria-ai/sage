Anchored by the Suisun Valley AVA\u2014recognized for\nrobust varietals like Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah\u2014the county also includes the cooler Green Valley, ideal\nfor Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, as well as the newer Winters Highlands and parts of Wild Horse Valley. These distinct\nmicroclimates and growing conditions make Solano County a rising star in the California wine scene, offering a\nmore laid-back alternative to nearby Napa while maintaining a strong tradition of viticulture.\n\u2022\nRolling Hills of Solano County\nThe rolling hills of Solano County, California, create a picturesque landscape that blends natural beauty with\nagricultural richness. These gently sloping terrains are part of the county\u2019s diverse topography, offering sweeping\nviews, fertile soils, and a mild Mediterranean climate. The hills not only support thriving vineyards and farms but\nalso serve as scenic backdrops for outdoor recreation, including hiking, biking, and wildlife observation. Their\nproximity to both the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento adds to their appeal, making the rolling hills of\nSolano County a serene and accessible retreat with both ecological and economic significance.\n\u2022\nBeauty of the Delta\nThe Delta in Solano County, California, is a stunning mosaic of winding waterways, lush wetlands, and open\nskies that captures the serene beauty of Northern California\u2019s natural landscape. This dynamic region, where the\nSacramento and San Joaquin Rivers meet the San Francisco Bay, offers a tranquil escape with its reflective waters,\nabundant birdlife, and vibrant marshes. The Delta\u2019s beauty lies not only in its peaceful scenery but also in its\nseasonal changes\u2014from golden sunsets over the sloughs to misty mornings where boats drift through the reeds.\nIt\u2019s a haven for fishing, kayaking, and exploration, offering a peaceful contrast to the bustle of nearby urban centers.\n\u2022\nSolano County Administration Center\nThe Solano County Administration Center, located at 675 Texas Street in downtown Fairfield, California, serves\nas the central hub for County government operations. This six-story facility consolidates County departments,\nhouses more than 800 employees and serves as a public gathering space, hosting exhibits, press conferences,\nand community events. Open to the public Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., the center is easily\naccessible and offers two hours of free parking in the adjacent garage.\n\nFrom the County Administrator\nSOLANO\nCOUNTY\nMay 23, 2025\nDear Members of the Board of Supervisors:\nI am pleased to present the FY2025/26 Recommended Budget for the County of Solano. \nThis budget reflects our ongoing commitment to responsible fiscal stewardship, service \nexcellence, and investment in the long-term health and vitality of our communities.\nThe proposed budget totals $1,645,088,474 for the County\u2019s Governmental Funds, \nrepresenting a decrease of 0.4% compared to FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. This reduction \ncan be largely attributed to the payoff of the 2004 and 2005 Pension Obligation Bonds, the \nfull allocation of American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds, and general belt tightening of \ndepartments in anticipation of slower revenue growth. Through prudent planning, strategic \npartnerships, and adaptive service delivery, we have maintained a balanced budget while \nadvancing key priorities set by your Board.\nThis year\u2019s budget process has taken place amid rising operational costs, evolving service demands, and heightened concern \nover the uncertain future of federal funding streams, including those tied to public health, housing, infrastructure, and social \nsafety net programs. As Congress continues to debate fiscal appropriations, Solano County remains vigilant in evaluating \npotential impacts to local programs that rely heavily on federal support. Federal funding cuts will likely be felt countywide, \nnot isolated to those departments that provide these mandated programs and community impacts may be significant. \nPrice escalation and tariffs are also a growing concern, especially in the areas of capital projects, fleet and technology. Impacts \nfrom the state\u2019s economic slowdown and a statewide decline in retail sales are negatively impacting all sales tax-based \nrevenues, such as Proposition 172 and realignment funds. \nProperty tax growth has been an important factor in balancing the FY2025/26 Recommended Budget. Such growth cannot be \ncounted upon year after year, and it will be important for the County to continue to explore opportunities to increase revenue \nsources such as local sales tax and transient occupancy tax. Recognizing this, the Board has made economic development a \ntop priority for the foreseeable future. The Board has also given direction to initiate an update to the 2008 General Plan with \na focus on economic development and housing. There is some initial funding for the General Plan update in this budget, \nwith the expectation that additional funding will be allocated during the fiscal year as further details are known about the \nfull scope of the update process. \nThe California Forever East Solano Initiative was withdrawn at the beginning of FY2024/25. To date, there has not been a \nsubmittal of a new initiative or a land use application. The potential of a shipbuilding facility in the Collinsville area on lands \nowned by California Forever has emerged as a potential additional proposal, although a specific proposal is still forthcoming. \nIf and when requests are submitted, the County fully expects all County costs for review of a new community, or a shipbuilding \nfacility will be offset by fees paid by the developer. \nFuture funding for Health and Social Services Department (H&SS) programs remains a critical challenge. Without sufficient \nfunding for both existing services and new unfunded mandates, the County faces significant short and long-term pressure on \nkey programs. Addressing the fiscal deficit within H&SS\u2019 Family Health Services (FHS) medical clinics, is crucial and the County \nis actively working to enhance encounter rates, boost productivity, and elevate quality measures, ensuring sustainable \nprogram operations and improved community outcomes. \nThe Recommended Budget reflects an increase in the workforce to 3,284.90 Full Time Equivalent (FTE) positions (excluding \nextra help positions). The net increase of 8.20 FTE from the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget includes 7.50 FTE that were added \nthroughout the course of FY2024/25 and net 5.70 FTE requested to be added as part of the FY2025/26 Recommended Budget.",

Most of the positions added are funded by sources other than the General Fund. \nOver the course of the last few years, we have been able to utilize ARPA and other one-time funding to expand our reach in \nthe community. We had the opportunity to purchase a Permanent Supportive Housing Facility to ensure behavioral \nhealth clients have a stable place to live. We advanced in our emergency radio system with a significant investment toward \nupgrading to a Project 25 system. Patwino Worrtla Kodoi Dihi Open Space Park opened as the fifth County Park with planned \nupgrades to Lake Solano and Sandy Beach Parks to make them more accessible and enjoyable for all. \nAs the funding utilized for opportunities such as those mentioned above come to a close, we must focus on core services to \nensure resilience, continuity, and adaptability in the face of fiscal challenges. This budget balances judicious reserve strategies \nwith necessary investments to ensure we can continue to provide services to everyone in our community. This includes \nretaining funding availability for emergency situations or unanticipated costs. \nThe FY2025/26 Recommended Budget was developed in collaboration with County departments, fiscal officers, and the \npublic, in alignment with Board-adopted policies and priorities. I want to thank the departments for their disciplined approach \nand partnership in ensuring fiscal accountability.\nOver the past year, Solano County has continued to navigate a complex landscape marked by economic uncertainty, evolving \ncommunity needs, and significant regional developments, and has remained in a solid fiscal condition. \nI respectfully submit this Recommended Budget for your consideration and look forward to the Board\u2019s deliberation and \nadoption.

Necessary actions initiate approval \nof the FY2025/26 Budget, which includes considering the number and classification of positions needed to fulfill \nCounty obligations and services, investments in technology and County facilities for both required maintenance \nand expansion, and how to ensure we are meeting current responsibilities while also planning for future \nopportunities and economic uncertainty. \nIn preparing the Recommended Budget, it was necessary to balance rising operational costs and evolving \nservice demands with unstable market conditions and heightened concern over the future of federal funding \nstreams. In addition, one-time funds associated with COVID-19 recovery, such as American Rescue Plan Act \n(ARPA) are no longer available to close any budget shortfalls. \nDepartments were asked to consider their requirements to provide services to the community and to factor in \nthe ability to address increased operating needs and labor costs, all while managing the challenges presented \nby an uncertain economic environment. Therefore, the resulting FY2025/26 Recommended Budget represents \na decrease of 0.4% over the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget, underscoring our prudent financial approach in \nunpredictable times. \nThe FY2025/26 Recommended Budget continues to address Board adopted Budget Strategies, Board Priorities, \nand sound financial practices and is balanced, although not structurally, and relies on federal, State, and local \nrevenues, the use of fund balances, draws from reserves, and some one-time funding. \nThe FY2025/26 Recommended Budget includes a section dedicated to the County Statistical Profile. This \nsection provides information on Solano County\u2019s current economic outlook and highlights indicators. This \ninformation includes population growth, unemployment, graduation rates, agricultural values, changes in \npersonal income, commuter trends, housing market statistics and housing and rental affordability, building \ntrends, and more. (See County Statistical Profile Section). Included in this budget summary are the following \nbudget-related sections: 1) Budget Overview; 2) Financial Summary; 3) General Fund Reserves, \nDesignations & Commitments, and Fund Balance; 4) Overview of the Federal and State Budgets; 5) \nEconomic Risks; 6) FY2025/26 General Fund Recommended Budget; 7) General Fund Fiscal Projections; \n8) Pending Issues; and 9) Summary of Recommendations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCounty Administrator \u2013 Budget Summary \nBudget Summary \nBill Emlen, County Administrator \n \n \n \n \nA-2 \n \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nBUDGET OVERVIEW \n \n \nThe FY2025/26 Recommended Budget for all Governmental Funds is balanced and totals $1,645,088,474 (Schedules 1 and 2). \nThe Recommended Budget represents a decrease of $6.85 million or 0.4% when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget \nand utilizes estimates for local, State, and federal revenues, as well as the use of fund balances with draws from reserves. \nThe budget reflects an increase of $7.8 million in the Special Revenue Funds, primarily due to increases in Public Safety, Health \nand Social Services, Road, Public Facilities Fees and other funds. The Capital Project Funds decreased by $2.8 million primarily \ndue to the timing of capital projects funded as part of the County\u2019s Capital Project Plan. The increase in the General Fund of $1.6 \nmillion is primarily due to increases in property tax revenues, offset by increases in appropriations in General Fund departments, \nreflecting increased labor costs due to wage, retirement, and health benefit increases totaling $4.0 million and increased General \nFund contributions to Public Safety and debt service when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. It should be noted that \nthe change in General Fund for FY2025/26 reflects an increase of only 0.4% when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget \nprimarily due to a decrease in use of General Fund \u2013 Capital Renewal Reserve of $3.0 million to fund capital projects and deferred \nmaintenance for various projects. Funded projects represent available resources to initiate new projects and support previously \nauthorized projects under the County\u2019s Capital Improvement Plan (CIP). The Debt Service Funds reflect a decrease of $13.5 \nmillion when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget primarily due to the full redemption of Pension Obligation Bonds (POBs) \nand the closing-out of the Pension Debt Service Fund. Overall, the FY2025/26 Recommended Budget for All Governmental Funds \ndecreased by 0.4% when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. \nThe FY2025/26 Recommended Budget uses the March 2025 Midyear Financial Report projected Fund Balances for 6/30/2025 \nand draws down $9.8 million from various Committed Fund Balances to meet planned County obligations. Consistent with sound \nfinancial practices, one-time General Fund revenues are recommended to be used to offset one-time costs wherever feasible. \nFY2025/26 uses some draws from designated reserves for accrued leave and capital renewal to fund one-time costs and liabilities \nfor employee accrued leave payoff, and costs for the major maintenance and capital improvements of County facilities. \nThe Recommended Budget reflects a workforce of 3,284.90 FTE positions, excluding extra-help positions, and makes \nassumptions about timing for filling existing vacancies. Budgeted positions reflect a net increase of 8.20 FTE compared to the \nFY2024/25 Adopted Budget. This increase is the result of a net 7.50 FTE increase in positions approved by the Board during the \nfiscal year, and a net 0.70 FTE increase (including expiring Limited-Term positions) included in the FY2025/26 Recommended \nBudget for the Board\u2019s consideration.

The graph indicates the \npercent of the total for each functional area required within \nthe Governmental Funds. \nPublic Protection represents the single largest category of \nCounty appropriations at 22.4% in the FY2025/26 Budget, \nwhich is an increase from 22.0% in the FY2024/25 Adopted \nBudget. Public Protection spending is projected to increase \n$4.2 million in FY2025/26 with the largest increases being in \nwages, retirement, health benefits, insurance, Countywide \nAdministrative Overhead, and inmate costs. \nPublic Assistance, at 16.5%, and Health, at 21.4%, \nrepresent the social safety net function of County \ngovernment, which together represent a decrease from \nFY2025/26. Public Assistance spending is projected to \ndecrease by $9.4 million in FY2025/26, primarily due to the \nfull allocation of one-time ARPA-SLFRF funds in FY2024/25. \nHealth spending is projected to decrease $0.8 million in \nFY2025/26, primarily due to decreases in revenues, the \nending of one-time COVID-19 funding, and a reduction in \nPublic Health-Intergovernmental Transfer (IGT) restricted \nfunds in Health Services. \nGeneral Fund Transfers represent a 14.8% share of the \nFY2025/26 Recommended Budget, reflecting increases in \nPublic Safety costs, social services programs, and costs for \ncapital improvements. \nThe Revenues by Source graph illustrates the different \nsources of funding to finance the Governmental Funds \nBudget. The largest revenue sources are Intergovernmental \nRevenue from State and federal agencies, which collectively \naccount for 38.3% of the Recommended Budget and \ngenerally have specific requirements on how funding can be \nused. Intergovernmental Revenue from State and federal \nagencies reflect a net decrease of $25.6 million primarily due \nto the full allocation of one-time ARPA-SLFRF funds in \nFY2024/25. Taxes represent 17.4% of the FY2025/26 \nrevenue projections, an increase from 16.4% from \nFY2024/25. \nOther Financing Sources, which includes the transfer of \nfunding between government budgets, represents 19.6% \nshare of the FY2025/26 projected revenues, which is down \nfrom 19.9% share in FY2024/25. Fund balance and reserves \nrepresents an 13.3% share of the FY2025/26 revenues, an \nincrease from FY2024/25. \n \n \n \nGOVERNMENTAL FUNDS \nTotal: $1,645,088,474 \n\nBudget Summary \nCounty Administrator \u2013 Budget Summary \nBill Emlen, County Administrator \n \n \n \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nA-5 \nThe General Fund Spending Plan (Fund 001) graph portrays \na total of $416 million. The Public Safety category represents \nthe single largest category of expenditures at 44.4% of the \nFY2025/26 Spending Plan, which is an increase from a \n42.1% proportional share in FY2024/25. This category \nincludes the Sheriff, District Attorney, Public Defender, \nAlternate Public Defender, Probation, and Other Public \nDefense. \nThe General Government/All Other category represents a \n31.5% share in FY2025/26, which is a decrease from a \n31.8% proportional share in FY2024/25. Functions listed \nunder this category include Agricultural Commissioner, \nResource Management, Registrar of Voters (ROV), General \nGovernment, courts Maintenance of Effort (MOE), and other \nMOEs. \nHealth & Social Services (H&SS) is the third largest category \nof General Fund use at 13.6% of the total, which is in-line \nwith the share in FY2024/25. The General Fund contribution \nto H&SS and IHSS is projected to decrease by $0.8 million \nin FY2025/26. \nThe FY2025/26 Recommended Budget includes the \nallocation of $7.9 million in one-time funds to Committed \nFund Balances which primarily reflects the transfer of \nanticipated year-end fund balance in the Pension Obligation \nBond to the Reserve for Employer PERS Rate Increase. \nThe Sources of General Fund Revenue graph provides \ninformation concerning General Fund financing for County \noperations. General Fund revenue is projected to increase \nby $18.7 million from the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget, \nprimarily due to increases in property taxes and ABX1 26 \ntaxes. \nRevenues derived from property values account for over half \nof General Fund revenues, with Property Taxes at 49.2% \nand ABX1 26 residual taxes and pass-through at 11.7%. \nProperty taxes include secured, unsecured, supplemental, \nunitary, property tax in-lieu of Vehicle License Fee (VLF), \nand property transfer tax. The Recommended Budget \nprojects a net increase of $14.0 million in these property \nrelated revenues when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted \nBudget. \nThe second largest source of revenue is Charges for \nServices at 16.0%, which includes fees, permits, licenses, \nproperty tax administration fees, and reimbursements for \nCounty costs of service. The third largest category is Fund \nBalance/contingency at 9.0%.

In establishing the Reserves, the County\u2019s intent is to have resources \nfor the \u201crainy day\u201d created by economic downturns; natural and manmade disasters; expected and unexpected costs for facility \nrepairs; and strategically step-down programs to align ongoing expenditures with ongoing revenues. \nIn good economic times the Board has consciously set monies aside to fund and finance some of the General Fund obligations, \nliabilities, and responsibilities. The strong fiscal policies established in the 1990\u2019s and maintained by the Board and the execution \nof those policies by the County departments continues to strengthen the County\u2019s financial position. This has enabled the County \nto manage through the Great Recession, other economic downturns, the COVID-19 pandemic and LNU Fire. The establishment \nof the General Reserve and the funding of the various General Fund designated Reserves are examples of prudent fiscal \nmanagement by the County. As we look to the future, the Board policies, Reserves, and designations will be a critical source for \nmanaging in an economy with constricted resources. In the following paragraphs, the unfunded obligations and potential liabilities \nthat lie ahead are discussed in connection with the General Fund Reserves, designations and commitments, and fund balances. \n \nThe initial estimation for the fund balance on June 30, 2025 is projected at $37.7 million and is based on the FY2024/25 Midyear \nprojection. Estimated Fund Balance includes $14 million for contingencies. \nOn March 11, 2025, the Board approved changes to the General Fund Contingency policy to require a fixed range of between \n$10 and $25 million. The range allows staff to recommend and establish a Contingency level during the annual budget process \nbased on current expectations and knowledge of potential unavoidable expenditures. The current recommendation from staff for \nFY2025/26 is to maintain a $14 million contingency. \nAppropriations for Contingencies are legal authorizations granted by the Board of Supervisors to be used for one-time, unexpected \nneeds that arise outside of the regular budget planning process. Pursuant to Government Code \u00a729130, access to the \nAppropriation for Contingency requires a 4/5th vote of the Board of Supervisors. \n \n\nBudget Summary \nCounty Administrator \u2013 Budget Summary \nBill Emlen, County Administrator \n \n \n \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nA-7 \n \nPer Board policy adopted on March 11, 2025, which is outlined in the Budget Construction and Legal Requirements section of the \nFY2025/26 Recommended Budget, the General Fund - General Reserve will be maintained at a target level equal to two to three \nmonths, or 16.7-25% of General Fund operating revenues, with a minimum balance of $20 million at all times. This level will be \nmaintained to provide the County with sufficient working capital and a comfortable margin to support one-time costs for the \nfollowing purposes: \n\u2022 \nWhen the County faces economic recession / depression and the County must take budget action. \n\u2022 \nWhen the County is impacted by a natural disaster or any other emergency. \n\u2022 \nWhen the County experiences unexpected declines in revenues and/or when unpredicted large one-time expenditures arise. \nIn circumstances where the General Fund - General Reserve has fallen below the established level, the County shall replenish \nthe deficiency within five fiscal years, or as soon as economic conditions allow, from the following revenue sources: year-end \nsurpluses, non-recurring revenues, or if legally permissible and with a defensible rational, from excess resources in other funds. \nSubject to the Board of Supervisors\u2019 restrictions, the following will guide how the General Fund - General Reserve should be used: \n1. \nUse the General Fund - General Reserve to phase into fiscal distress periods gradually, focusing on maintaining the Board\u2019s \npriorities. \n2. \nTo the extent possible, use the General Fund - General Reserve as the last resort to balance the County Budget. \n3. \nTo the extent possible, the spending down of the General Fund - General Reserve should not exceed $6 million a year (Board \nof Supervisors\u2019 policy direction on February 13, 2007; reaffirmed on March 11, 2025). \n4. \nThe General Fund - General Reserve should not be used to support recurring operating expenditures. \n5. \nThe General Fund - General Reserve is subject to restrictions imposed by Government Code \u00a729086, which limits the Board\u2019s \naccess to the General Reserve during the annual budget process and requires 4/5th vote by the Board of Supervisors. \nThe FY2025/26 Recommended Budget for the General Fund - General Reserve is projected at $49.5 million. Based on Board \npolicy, the minimum reserve target is 16.7% of General Fund operating revenues, which equates to $61.5 million in FY2025/26. \nThe current County General Reserve is $49.5 million, which is 80.4% of the minimum target goal. Per Board direction on March \n11, 2025, this reserve will need to funded / increased over a five-year period to achieve the minimum reserve target.",

Given that pension rates were \nexpected to increase in the next five years, coupled with a Board of Supervisors\u2019 stated goal of achieving a retirement funding \nratio of 90% for both CalPERS plans (Miscellaneous and Safety), the County Debt Advisory Committee reviewed options to reduce \nthe unfunded liability in FY2014/15. On February 10, 2015, the Committee presented a funding policy to the Board that included \nplacing one-time funds into a Pension Trust to help reduce the unfunded pension liabilities, thereby reducing future employer \nretirement rates. The Board approved this policy, authorized the creation of an IRS 115 Trust Account, and agreed to fund it with \none-time funds in the amount of $20 million at the end of FY2014/15. As of June 30, 2024, (most recent actuarial report), the \nCounty\u2019s unfunded actuarial accrued liability for both the Miscellaneous Plan and Safety Plan is $799 million (70.9% Funded \nRatio). This figure includes the former Court employees and Solano County Fair Association employees. \nIn FY2017/18, FY2018/19, FY2021/22, FY2022/23, FY2023/24, and FY2024/25 the Board of Supervisors authorized additional \npayments of $6.6 million, $6 million, $8.6 million, $5.6 million, $8.2 million, and $8.0 million respectively, to the CalPERS Public \nSafety Plan unfunded liability account funded by the Pension Obligation Fund and the CalPERS Rate Reserve. These additional \npayments reduced the unfunded liability and reduced future pension costs to the County. \nThe FY2025/26 Recommended Budget for the Employer PERS Rate increases includes both the value of the IRS 115 Trust at \n$34.6 million and the Reserve for Employer PERS Rate Increase at $37.2 million for a total reserve of $71.8 million (Schedule 4). \nCapital Renewal Reserve (Deferred Capital/Maintenance Projects) \nIn 2007, the Board established a Committed Fund Balance for capital renewal/deferred maintenance projects to fund deferred \nmaintenance, unexpected maintenance, and/or future maintenance of County facilities. The Board\u2019s adopted policies and \nstrategies to address unfunded liabilities center on the need to: \n\u2022 \nReplace infrastructure and building systems in aging County facilities where County public services are provided. \n\u2022 \nAchieve code compliance in relation to current regulations. \n\u2022 \nEffectively manage and reduce the County\u2019s risks associated with the programs dispensed from County-occupied buildings. \n\nBudget Summary \nCounty Administrator \u2013 Budget Summary \nBill Emlen, County Administrator \n \n \n \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nA-9 \nAnnually, through the review and approval of the 5-Year Capital Facilities Improvement Plan (CFIP), the Board reviews the status \nof County building infrastructure, building systems, and maintenance needs. The Board weighs these exposures against available \nresources to determine how to budget for these facility demands. \nThe Department of General Services provided the Board with a report titled 2016 Facilities Condition Analysis, prepared by EMG \nof Walnut Creek (Consultant). A Facilities Condition Assessment (FCA) was conducted in FY2023/24. Condition information is \nused to set priorities in the CFIP. In-line with the Board approved 2016 FCA, the County is required to maintain a minimum \ninvestment of $3-$5 million annually (depending on cost of labor, materials, and equipment) to maintain the County facilities \nportfolio within a \u201cGood\u201d range, which is the minimum maintenance level chosen by the Board in order to continue fixed asset \nprotection, preservation, and renewal. The annual budget recommendations from the County Administrator\u2019s Office endeavors to \nset aside a minimum of $3 million, if feasible and when possible, additional available one-time funding to address capital facility \nneeds. \nOn February 11, 2025, the Department of General Services presented to the Board a status update on capital projects included \nin the FY2025/26 Recommended Budget. Based on a preliminary prioritization of projects under consideration, the department \nprovided recommendations for funding specific projects. \nThe FY2025/26 Recommended Budget for Capital Renewal Reserve is $13.6 million and reflects a draw of $7.8 million from \nreserves to address facility renewal needs. \nProperty Tax System Replacement \nThe Solano County Integrated Property System (SCIPS) is the County\u2019s current internally developed and maintained property tax \nsystem, originally developed in 1982. On April 4, 2017, the Board authorized staff to proceed with the replacement of the SCIPS. \nThe total estimated cost to replace the SCIPS is $10 million and full implementation will be completed over multiple years. To fund \nthe replacement system, including the data migration and full implementation, the Board authorized the creation of a reserve in \nFY2017/18 for the project in the amount of $10 million, funded by reclassifying funds from the General Fund - General Reserve. \nThese funds were a loan to the project, repaid over time once the project was completed. In March 2023, the County went \u201clive\u201d \nwith the new property tax system, the County Assessment and Taxation System (CATS) Project. The FY2025/26 Recommended \nBudget reflects no remaining balance in the Property Tax System Replacement reserve. \nApproximately 42.5% of the total cost or an estimated $4.3 million will be recovered from cities and other agencies through the \nproperty tax administrative fee. The balance of $5.7 million will be a General Fund cost charged to the County Assessor, the \nAuditor-Controller, and the Tax Collector based on a seven-year loan repayment schedule as approved by the County Debt \nAdvisory Committee. \nUnfunded Employee Accrued Leave Payoff \nIn accordance with the Board\u2019s Fund Balance Policy, in FY2005/06 the Board established and maintains a General Fund Reserve \nfor Accrued Employee Leave Payoff. Each year, the Auditor-Controller and Human Resources work with the County \nAdministrator\u2019s Office to assess the funds necessary to pay for any unanticipated leave payoff that departments cannot absorb \nwith existing appropriations. Based on the County\u2019s workforce, continued utilization of the Accrued Leave Payoff funds is \nanticipated in FY2025/26. The reserve has a current balance of $2.6 million. It is recommended that the Board utilize $2.0 million \nof this balance to fund Employee Accrued Leave Payoff in FY2025/26. The FY2025/26 Recommended Budget for the Unfunded \nEmployee Leave Payoff reserve would be reduced to $0.7 million. It is currently anticipated that any remaining balance \nappropriated in the General Expenditures Budget for Accrued Leave Payoff for FY2024/25 will be applied to the General Fund \nReserve for Accrued Employee Leave Payoff at year-end, increasing the balance to $2 million to comply with the Board\u2019s policy \nas outlined in the Budget Construction and Legal Requirements section of the FY2025/26 Recommended Budget. \nLong-Term Receivables \nLong-Term Receivables represents amounts outstanding and payable to the County, not available as cash, which cannot be spent \nbecause they are either (a) not in a spendable form or (b) legally or contractually required to be maintained intact. It includes long-\nterm loans and notes receivable, inventories, and prepaid items. The FY2025/26 Recommended Budget for long-term receivables \nis $20.7 million.",

During the existence of the RDA, a percentage of \nthe redevelopment funding was required to be used to meet the housing needs of low/moderate-income residents. As a result of \nthe dissolution of the redevelopment agencies, this restricted source of funding was no longer available to address housing needs. \nAs of February 1, 2012, any unspent housing funds in RDAs were redistributed to the local taxing agencies as one-time revenues. \nDuring this time, the State passed SB 375 (Chapter 728, Statutes of 2008) which directed the California Air Resources Board to \nset regional targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. SB 375 included requirements for coordinating regional housing \nneeds allocation with the regional transportation process. In FY2013/14, the Board approved the County Administrator\u2019s \nrecommendation to establish the Housing / SB 375 reserve using $2 million of these one-time housing set-aside funds for SB 375 \nimplementation and/or to address temporary and long-term housing needs for children, families, special needs clients, and older, \nindigent, and disabled adults. To date this funding has been utilized as a loan to MidPen Housing Corporation to create 35 units \nof affordable housing (Sunset Pines Apartments) and for a twenty-year purchase agreement for 20 transitional housing beds at \nthe former Mission Solano (now known as Shelter Solano). In the FY2025/26 Recommended Budget, the current balance in the \nHousing / SB 375 reserve is $1.4 million. The County Administrator anticipates that some of these funds may be needed in \nFY2025/26 to provide local matching funds in addressing housing needs for at-risk or vulnerable populations. \nTechnology and Communications \nTo support long-term planning and ensure uninterrupted mission-critical operations, it is recommended that the Board establish a \ndedicated Technology and Communications Reserve to address future replacement costs and modernization of key infrastructure \ncomponents, including P25 radios and associated communication equipment. Given the essential role these systems play in public \nsafety and operational coordination, it is vital to anticipate end-of-life cycles and allocate funding proactively. The reserve will also \ncover other core technology assets such as network hardware, software licenses, and IT support systems. Establishing this \nreserve enhances fiscal responsibility, reduces the impact of unforeseen failures, and provides a structured approach to sustaining \nessential services. Recommendations to fund this new reserve will be brought forward to the Board at a later date. \nOVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE BUDGETS \nFederal Budget Update \nIn March 2025, Congress approved, and President Trump signed into law a $1.7 trillion Continuing Resolution (CR) funding all \nfederal departments and agencies through September 30, 2025. The final budget is consistent with appropriation levels set during \nthe previous administration, with a notable decrease of $13 billion in non-defense spending, reflecting a cut of all federal earmarks, \nand an increase of $6 billion in defense spending now totaling $847 billion in discretionary defense spending which includes $3.3 \nbillion for shipbuilding. The bill extended several expiring programs, including the National Flood Protection Program, Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families (TANF), and several public health programs within Medicare and Medicaid. \nThe Office of Management and Budget has submitted the federal fiscal year (FFY) 2026 budget to Congress and it is currently \nunder review. Early indications include a reduction of $163 billion, or a 22.6% reduction in non-defense discretionary spending \nwith increases to defense spending totaling 13% and increases to Homeland Security totaling 65%. Both shipbuilding and aircraft \nfunding make up the proposed increases to defense spending. If enacted, programs under consideration of elimination include \nthose dealing with climate, education, and health and housing. It is anticipated that Congress will not approve a new budget by \nthe October 1 deadline and a CR is likely in order to maintain federal funds for departments and agencies. \nStaff will continue to monitor the federal budget and will return to the Board as necessary. \nState Budget Update \nThe Governor is expected to release his proposed May Revision towards the end of the second week of May, which will reflect \nthe revenue and expenditure trends during the first five months of 2025. While the State experienced significant surpluses in \nrecent years, updated reporting from the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office (LAO) project a balanced budget for FY2025/26. A revised \nState Budget Update will be included as part of the FY2025/26 Supplemental Budget. \nState Revenue Trends \nThe LAO projects strong growth in the current fiscal year in the three largest taxable areas (income, corporate, and sales) with \nmuted growth anticipated beyond the current year. Income taxes are the largest area of increase at $3.8 billion above projections \nand are attributed to stock market activity that is not anticipated to continue.

The Federal Reserve \nmaintained the \u201cfederal funds\u201d benchmark interest rate between 4.25% - 4.5% in May 2025 and it is uncertain how the ongoing \nrate reduction pause will continue amid levels of economic uncertainty around the impacts of current tariff policy on inflation. The \nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported an annual inflation rate totaling 2.4% as of March 2025, while the Federal Reserve aims \nto maintain an inflation rate of 2%. The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage totals 6.9% as of May 2025, mostly \nunchanged from the same time last year and a significant increase from a long span of historically low interest rates. In addition, \nthe 10-year U.S. Treasury Bond totals 4.3% as of May 2025, down from 4.6% in May of 2024. \nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate as of April 2025 was 4.2%, up from 3.9% in April 2024. The \nConsumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) rose 2.4% as of March 2025, from one year ago, with energy decreasing \n3.3%, the food index increasing 3.0%, and all items less food and energy increasing by 2.8%. U.S. homebuilders continue to face \nchallenges due to elevated interest rates and concerns related to tariffs, while retail markets continue to grow despite higher \ninterest rates. \nCalifornia \nCalifornia is now the fourth largest economy in the world, totaling $4.1 trillion and with a growth rate of 6%, outpacing the other \nthree top economies. While the State experienced significant surpluses in recent years, updated reporting from the Legislative \nAnalyst\u2019s Office presents a balanced budget for FY2025/26, indicating deficits are likely in future years. The Legislative Analyst\u2019s \nOffice reports that the Governor\u2019s budget includes $4.5 billion in a Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties, higher than in past \nyears. California relies on high-income taxpayer stock-based compensation revenues, which can be volatile as rapid changes to \nstock values can significantly impact California\u2019s revenue. The Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office reports the proposed budget is relying \nagain on the State\u2019s \u201crainy day\u201d fund to balance the budget. \nUnemployment figures total 3.9% in the San Francisco Metropolitan statistical area and 4.8% in the Sacramento Metropolitan \nstatistical area as compared with the State\u2019s unemployment rate of 5.4%, as of February 2025. Housing continues to be a \nchallenge statewide, with the pace of production not meeting demand. The high cost of home construction continues and is due \nto high labor and material costs. \nStaff will be monitoring closely the State and federal economic developments and the budget decisions and will return to the Board \nas necessary. \nFY2025/26 GENERAL FUND RECOMMENDED BUDGET \nThe FY2025/26 Recommended Budget for the General Fund of $416 million is balanced anticipating revenues of $368.5 million, \ndrawdowns from Committed Fund Balances of $9.8 million from Accrued Leave Payoffs, Capital Renewal, and use of Fund \nBalance ($37.7 million). \nThe Recommended Budget for General Fund reflects revenues of $368.5 million, an increase of $18.6 million excluding reserves \nwhen compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget of $349.9 million. The increase in revenues anticipates a net increase in Tax",

      "text": "Budget Summary \nCounty Administrator \u2013 Budget Summary \nBill Emlen, County Administrator \n \n \n \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nA-13 \nRevenue Assumptions - From General Revenue Projections: \nThe County\u2019s General Fund Budget is financed with General Revenues (refer to BU 1101), the use of certain one-time revenues, \nFund Balance, and General Reserves, if necessary. The FY2025/26 Recommended Budget includes the use of General Fund \u2013 \nCommitted Fund Balances of $7.819 million from Capital Renewal and $2.0 million from Unfunded Employee Leave Payoff. \nThe significant revenue assumptions from the General Revenues budget include: \n\u2022 \nAn estimated 3% increase in assessed values compared to the FY2024/25 corrected assessment roll, resulting in projected \nincreases of $5.4 million in Current Secured Property Taxes and $3.5 million in property tax in-lieu of vehicle license fees \n(VLF) revenues. Projections in FY2026/27 and FY2027/28 anticipate increases of 4%. Based on the corrected assessment \nroll as of June 30, 2024, 4,353 properties still remain on Proposition 8 Tax Reduction status related to the negative economic \nimpacts from the Great Recession. The number of properties under Proposition 8 Tax Reduction status will remain under \nevaluation by the Assessor/Recorder. \n\u2022 \nSupplemental Secured Property Taxes is expected to increase $2.0 million due to the collection of past year supplemental \ntax bills. Due to the County\u2019s transition to a new property tax system, supplemental bills were temporarily delayed, resulting \nin a projected one-time increase. \n\u2022 \nABX1 26 Taxes are projected to increase by $1.4 million based on projected tax increment revenues. \n\u2022 \nCurrent Unsecured Property Taxes are projected to increase $1.4 million based on anticipated increases in business property \nvalues. \nThe County Budget is also financed by Proposition 172 revenues (sales tax) for Public Safety and 1991/2011 Realignment funds \n(State sales tax and vehicle license fees) primarily for Health and Social Services (H&SS) and Public Safety Departments, State \nand federal funding, and Fees for Services. While these revenues do not flow directly into the General Fund, they indirectly impact \nthe General Fund. \n\u2022 \nThe Recommended Budget reflects $50.2 million in Proposition 172 funding. FY2025/26 anticipates a 1.3% decrease from \nthe FY2024/25 Adopted Budget based on changes in the distribution formula as the State\u2019s economy has been impacted by \ninflationary measures, statewide decline in retail sales, and a potential recession. As Proposition 172 funds decrease for the \nCounty, the Public Safety Fund (Fund 900) departments may require an increase in County revenue support in the delivery \nof mandatory services. \n\u2022 \nThe FY2025/26 Recommended Budget reflects $75.1 million drawdown in 1991 State \u2013 Local Realignment revenues, an \nincrease of $3.8 million; and $115.4 million in 2011 Realignment funds, an increase of $1.2 million. The draw of Realignment \nfunds is used to maintain programs primarily in H&SS and Public Safety. The increase in 1991 Realignment represents a \nhigher need to cover projected cash flows. If federal and State revenues come in higher than anticipated, then General Fund \nContributions may be reduced as long as the County\u2019s Maintenance of Effort is met. If federal and State revenues are lower \nthan anticipated, then there may be an increased demand for General Fund or programs may need to be adjusted. \nExpenditure Assumptions: \n\u2022 \nRetirement costs are projected to continue to increase based on approved CalPERS actuarial assumptions for the proposed \nrates by CalPERS. Included is a rate of 32.58% for Miscellaneous and 39.13% for Safety in FY2025/26. \n\u2022 \nHealth insurance costs are projected to increase 5% per year based on past rate history for FY2025/26, with 5%-7% annual \nincreases likely in future years. \n\u2022 \nLabor costs in FY2025/26 reflect the annualized cost increases for the collective bargaining agreements approved in \nFY2022/23. The FY2025/26 Recommended Budget reflects no changes in compensation resulting from upcoming labor \nnegotiations. \n\u2022 \nThe County General Fund Contributions through FY2025/26 are listed below: \n\uf0a7 \nGeneral Fund support for Public Safety is projected to increase from $174.6 million to $181.0 million; a $6.4 million net \nincrease. This increase is primarily due to increases in wages, retirement, health benefits, insurance, Countywide \nAdministrative Overhead, and inmate costs. In addition, the increase is also due to decreases in institutional care and \nProposition 172 revenues.",

The decrease is primarily due to prior year, one-time transfers in from the American Rescue \nPlan Act (ARPA) Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) to address the structural deficit in Family \nHealth Services (FHS) due to insufficient revenue generated by the Primary Care and Dental Clinics. All remaining funds \ndesignated by the Board to be used under the ARPA-SLFRF Revenue Replacement category were transferred in \nFY2024/25. For FY2025/26, the structural deficit in FHS will be primarily funded with 1991 Public Health Realignment. \n\u2022 \nThe FY2025/26 Recommended Budget includes a Contingency appropriation of $14 million. \nGeneral Fund Deficit Reduction Strategies for FY2025/26 if Revenue Shortfall: \nThe Department Heads and the CAO will continue to utilize the Board Adopted Budget Strategies to guide the Departments in \ntheir continuing efforts to contain costs and where possible, reduce further and serve as guidelines if revenues do not materialize \nas anticipated. \nStrategy 1: Elimination or freezing of all vacant positions and only fill positions that are \u201cMission Critical\u201d to the organization. \nStrategy 2: Continue to review all discretionary and mandatory programs. \nStrategy 3: Seek employee concessions, in addition to the current MOUs and agreements in place or in progress. \nStrategy 4: Reduce General Fund Contribution to Health & Social Services and Public Safety departments, reducing the level of \nservice to the community. \nStrategy 5: Continue reducing the County\u2019s footprint in buildings in Fairfield, Vallejo, and Vacaville and move employees out of \nleased space and into County-owned space; consider selling older/outdated County buildings to reduce operational expenses. \nStrategy 6: Continue automating the delivery of services so reorganization/downsizing opportunities can continue. \nPENDING ISSUES \nBoard of Supervisors\u2019 Priorities: On April 18, 2023, the Board conducted a priority-setting workshop. Board members identified \nseveral topics which were grouped into five major categories: Economic Development, Agriculture Preservation and Development, \nHousing, County Workforce Development, and County Services - Regulations and Policies. On October 8, 2024, the Board held a \nsecond session to provide additional feedback and direction. Staff continues to make progress and will be providing an update on \ndepartment workplans and continuing efforts related to the implementation of Board priorities in the coming months. Departments \ncontinue to evaluate funding needs related to the implementation of Board priorities and any additional funding for the \nimplementation of specific action items related to Board priorities are included as part of the FY2025/26 Recommended Budget. \nSupplemental Budget: Historically, the County Administrator\u2019s Office prepares a Supplemental Budget document following the \ncompletion and distribution of the Recommended Budget, as more of an administrative function, primarily to address accounting \nnotations. To the degree possible, the Supplemental Budget may reflect additional program and service changes that can be \nexpected based on the Governor\u2019s May Revision and ultimately approved legislation including budget Trailer Bills. \nThe Recommended Budget document was prepared early in the March/April timeframe to facilitate the mandated public release \nof the budget in May 2025. To accommodate the release, the departmental budgets reflect only the known and approved State \nand federal programs changes as of April 2025, which will take effect July 1, 2025. \nProposition 1: Proposition 1, approved by voters in March 2024, contained two broad components: 1) changes the Mental Health \nServices Act (MHSA) to the Behavioral Health Services Act (BHSA) and adjusts funding and funding categories; and 2) approves \na $6.4 billion bond to build more facilities for mental health care and drug or alcohol treatment, and more housing for people with \nmental health, and drug or alcohol challenges. While Proposition 1 makes no changes to the amount of revenue collected through \nthe tax, it does reduce the amount available to counties and how counties may use the funding. Most significantly, BHSA creates \na requirement that one-third (30%) of the funds allocated to each county must be spent on housing. It also shifts 10% of the \nfunding (versus 5%) from counties to the State for workforce initiatives and prevention. Another significant change will be made \nto the planning process for BHSA requiring an Integrated Plan for all behavioral health services that includes budget and outcome \ninformation across all funding sources. Implementation activities are underway in order to adhere to the new Integrated Plan \nrequired by July 1, 2026. \nChild Welfare Services: Foster Family Agencies (FFAs) are required to maintain insurance.

As a result, FFAs are being forced to seek new insurance providers, often at significantly higher costs. This financial strain \nhas put many FFAs at risk of closure as their insurance policies expire. \nAs of December 2024, there are 108 children placed in an FFA. There is growing concern that potential FFA closures could lead \nto the displacement of some or all of these children. The situation is being closely monitored to ensure that the well-being and \nplacement stability of these children are not adversely affected. \nIn-Home Supportive Services (IHSS): IHSS Public Authority (PA) and SEIU 2015 completed negotiations in 2021, which fixed the \nIHSS provider wage at $1.20 over the California State minimum wage. In January 2023, the California minimum wage increased \nto $15.50 per hour. As a result of this increase, the Solano IHSS wage was fixed at $16.70 per hour through 2024. On January \n1, 2025, the California minimum wage increased to $16.50 per hour. As a result of this increase, the Solano IHSS wage increased \nto $17.70 per hour. IHSS Providers in Solano County who work more than 65 hours per month remain eligible for a supplemental \nhealth plan that includes prescriptions, vision, and dental care paid for by the IHSS PA. \nIHSS PA and SEIU 2015 labor contract expired on June 30, 2024. When the successor contract is completed, it is anticipated that \nthere will be changes in wages or benefits resulting in increased costs and adjustments. \nFamily Health Services - Clinics: Family Health Services (FHS) continues to focus on operational, quality, and process \nimprovements in order to optimize client services, quality outcomes, and revenue generation and anticipates implementing a \nnumber of changes, including provision of a patient portal, improved communication with clients using telehealth, and more robust \nappointment scheduling. With the completion of the implementation of OCHIN EPIC, electronic medical record system, provider \nperformance and client throughput, as well as access to quality data is anticipated to substantially improve, which can improve \noverall patient outcomes as well as generate encounter-based revenue. \nIn order to improve the financial sustainability of the clinics, FHS is pursuing several initiatives, including encounter rate \nadjustments for each of the FHS clinics, increased quality indicator revenue from Partnership HealthPlan of California (PHC), and \nincreased provider productivity. Chiropractic services have been added to the three adult primary care clinics and licensed \nmarriage and family therapy services at the Fairfield pediatric clinic. These new services have been approved by Health Resources \nand Services Administration (HRSA) and will trigger reassessment by the California Department of Health Care Services of the \ncurrent encounter rates at each of the FHS clinic sites. The outcome of this effort is estimated to be completed in spring 2026 with \nany rate adjustments retroactive to July 1, 2025. This effort is not anticipated to fully eliminate the structural deficit and productivity \n(daily encounters) will also need to increase. \nOn April 25, 2025, Solano County Family Health Services received an official notice from Partnership HealthPlan of California \nstating that FHS was placed on a network management Corrective Action Plan (CAP) due to the lack of necessary improvements \nto increase access and quality for pediatric members at the Vacaville and Vallejo clinic sites. The two clinic sites demonstrated \nlow rates of well-child visits and member grievances related to pediatric appointment availability. As a result, FHS will not be open \nto new pediatric patient assignments until improvement is found as measured by a plan to meet timely access standards, increase \nappointment access for pediatric patients before December 31, 2025, and reduce grievances related to appointment access. \nOpening of the Vacaville and Vallejo clinic sites for new pediatric patients would be considered after December 2025 if notable \nimprovements are found. \nCalifornia Advancing and Innovating in Medi-Cal (CalAIM): As part of California Advancing and Innovating Medi-Cal (CalAIM) \nimplementation, Medi-Cal managed care plans are required to work with county public health and behavioral health agencies to \ndevelop Community Health Needs Assessments. For about 20 years, Solano County Public Health has worked with health care \nagencies, including Kaiser Permanente, NorthBay Medical Center, and Sutter Solano Medical Center to develop the Community \nHealth Needs Assessment. This partnership will be expanded to Solano County Behavioral Health and Partnership HealthPlan of \nCalifornia. Additionally, Solano County Public Health will continue to work with these partners to develop the Community Health \nImprovement Plan and use it as a tool for prioritizing funding and contracts with community-based organizations. The next \nCommunity Health Assessment update process will begin in 2025. \nLanterman-Petris-Short (LPS): Senate Bill 43, which is an unfunded mandate, expands California\u2019s Lanterman-Petris-Short (LPS) \nconservatorship law by updating the criteria for determining if a person is \u201cgravely disabled,\u201d the standard for LPS conservatorship \neligibility.

California became the first state approved to offer these Medicaid services to eligible youth and \nadults in state prisons, county jails, and youth correctional facilities. The initiative ensures continuity of healthcare coverage and \nservices during incarceration and post-release, providing medications, medical equipment, and transition support. Successful \nimplementation requires collaboration across multiple agencies, including Behavioral Health, Public Health, Probation, Department \nof Information Technology, and community organizations. While the PATH funding supports planning and initial implementation, \nit is not intended to cover ongoing operating costs beyond the startup phase. Solano Behavioral Health is pending the Sheriff\u2019s \nOffice implementation of PATH requirements that include electronic health records and Medi-Cal billing within the jail in order to \ncoordinate care pre-release and support early access to services. \n2011 Public Safety Realignment/AB 109 Funding: The Recommended Budget reflects the County\u2019s share of the estimated total \nAB 109 base and growth funding allocations statewide. The budget recommendation by the Solano Community Corrections \nPartnership (CCP) includes an estimated allocation of $21.1 million to fund programs previously approved by the Board under the \n2011 Solano Public Safety Realignment Act Implementation Plan. AB 109 Growth funding, which is based on statewide revenue \nestimates, is subject to change pending the final State revenue figures. County staff is continuing to monitor the State allocation \nof AB 109 funds as departments address the mandated changes resulting from the implementation of 2011 Public Safety \nRealignment. \nProposition 172 Public Safety Funding: Proposition 172 is a key revenue source for our County Public Safety Departments and is \nbased on \u00bd cent statewide sales tax funding for Public Safety Services. Proposition 172 is projected at $50.2 million in the \nRecommended Budget, representing an increase from revenues projected at FY2024/25 Midyear. The County is anticipating a \ndecrease in Proposition 172 revenues under the current year\u2019s Adopted Budget as the State\u2019s economy has been impacted by \ninflationary measures, a statewide decline in retail sales, and a potential recession. Staff is working with HdL, the County\u2019s Sales \nTax consultant, to monitor the statewide trend in Proposition 172 funding and will update the Board as necessary during the year. \nProposition 36: On November 5, 2024, Proposition 36, known as \u201cThe Homelessness, Drug Addiction, and Theft Reduction Act\u201d \nwas passed and went into effect on December 18, 2024. Prop. 36 modifies existing law and adds substantive charges and \nenhancements to areas of the Penal Code and Health and Safety Code regarding theft, property damage, and drug-related crimes. \nIt establishes a Treatment Mandated Felony option which is triggered by meeting certain criteria and prior drug convictions. \nProbation, Behavioral Health, and the Sheriff\u2019s office are working collaboratively with the Court to address the impacts. \nJuvenile Justice SB 823: Senate Bill 823 outlines the process for the closure of the Division of Juvenile Justice (DJJ), effective \nJuly 1, 2021. As a result, counties have been expected to serve these youths locally. The legislation also included the development \nof a County Plan, which describes the programs, services, and interventions provided to youths as well as facility and operational \nchanges that will take place at the local juvenile detention facility. Probation will continue to work with the Juvenile Justice \nCoordinating Council (JJCC), treatment providers, and other stakeholders to meet the needs of this population in detention and in \nthe community. The SB 823 funding formula is currently in the process of being reviewed by the Office of Youth and Community \nRestoration (OYCR) and resulting changes may impact services and staff of the Secure Youth Treatment Facilities (SYTF) \nprogram. \nProperty Tax Appeals / Prop 8 Values: As of May 5, 2025, there are 707 active property tax appeals on file with the Clerk of the \nBoard. Property owners can appeal the value enrolled by the Assessor to the local Board of Equalization, the Assessment Appeals \nBoard. The difference between the Assessor\u2019s value and the property owner\u2019s estimate of value is the assessed value \u201cat risk\u201d \nwhich is currently $3.0 billion, over multiple years. The resolution of these appeals may have a significant impact on the County\u2019s \nproperty tax revenues. Efforts continue by the Assessor, with assistance from County Counsel, to address and resolve appeals \nand reduce the number and value of outstanding appeals to address the uncertainty. Nearly 90% of all appeals get resolved \nwithout going to hearing. \nThe recovering real estate market results in a decrease in the number of properties on Proposition 8 status (a temporary reduction \nin property values below their established Proposition 13 base year value). According to the Solano County Assessor-Recorder\u2019s \nOffice, as of June 30, 2024, 4,353 of the County\u2019s 154,505 assessed parcels remain on Proposition 8 status, compared to 78,000 \nparcels in 2012.",

Due to the likelihood of fire danger, it is \nexpected that there will be Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) events in FY2025/26 despite PG&E\u2019s efforts to harden its system \nand refine PSPS boundaries to minimize the impacts on its customers. The County continues to focus on resiliency and \npreparedness for fire-related emergencies. County staff remain ready to respond and coordinate with other agencies as needed \nthrough the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and Emergency Operations Plan should an emergency occur. \nLaw Enforcement Services to Cities: Currently, the Sheriff\u2019s Office provides contracted law enforcement services to the City of Rio \nVista. Over the last two years, the City of Vallejo has experienced significant officer vacancies and, together with financial troubles, \nhas asked the Sheriff\u2019s Office for assistance. The Sheriff\u2019s Office has provided limited support; however, the City is requesting \ndedicated temporary assistance until they can hire adequate staffing. Options and associated costs have been explored and a \nterms sheet was provided to the City of Vallejo in December of 2024. The Sheriff requested Board authorization to move forward \nwith contract negotiations on May 6, 2025. The Sheriff\u2019s Office plans on returning to the Board with a proposed contract no later \nthan June 24, 2025 with a twelve-month service contract beginning January 2026. The potential need for contracted law \nenforcement services may continue to arise as other cities within Solano County are experiencing staffing shortages combined \nwith lower operating revenues. \nSUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS \nFor Board consideration are recommended budgets as outlined in the following pages of this document. In submitting a balanced \nbudget, the County Administrator utilized an available Fund Balance of $37.7 million as reflected in the FY2024/25 Midyear \nprojection. If the FY2024/25 Midyear projection for Fund Balance is not met, or there is an unanticipated shortfall in the FY2024/25 \nGeneral Fund operating budget, the County Administrator will prepare additional recommendations for Board consideration in the \nSupplemental Budget document. However, if the amount of the General Fund\u2019s Year-end Fund Balance at June 30, 2025 exceeds \nthe Midyear projections for FY2024/25, then the County Administrator is authorized to direct the Auditor-Controller to increase \nUnrestricted Fund Balance to finance the gap between revenues and expenditures for FY2025/26 of any amount and to transfer \nyear-end General Fund Balances to all or some of the following Committed Fund Balances and reserves in the following manner: \n1. \nAny amount up to $10 million to Deferred Maintenance/Capital Renewal Reserves. \n2. \nAny amount up to $10 million to the CalPERS Reserves and/or 115 Trust. \n3. \nAny amount up to $5 million to the Technology and Communications Reserve. \n4. \nAny amount up to $2 million to Accrued Leave Payoff. \n5. \nAny amount up to $5 million to General Fund Reserves.\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis Page Intentionally Left Blank",

The net difference of 0.70 \nFTE results from the addition of 11.70 FTE included in the FY2025/26 Recommended Budget, offset by the deletion of 6.0 FTE \nvacant positions, and 5.0 FTE expiring Limited-Term positions. These changes over the past fiscal year, and the recommended \nchanges in the FY2025/26 Recommended Budget, primarily reflect the County\u2019s continued efforts to align allocated positions with \nevolving operational requirements and State and federal mandates in public safety, public ways, and the delivery of health and \nsocial service programs. \nPERMANENT POSITION ALLOCATION BY FUNCTIONAL AREA: FY2016/17 to FY2025/26 \n \n \nFunction \n \nStaffing \nChanges During \nFY2024/25 \n \nRecommended \nBudget \nChanges for \nFY2025/26 \n \nTotal Change \nfrom FY2024/25 \nto FY2025/26 \nAll Others \n \n1.00 \n \n0.00 \n \n1.00 \nPublic Ways \n \n0.00 \n \n2.00 \n \n2.00 \nPublic Assistance \n \n0.00 \n \n(2.00) \n \n(2.00) \nHealth Services \n0.00 \n0.70 \n0.70 \nPublic Protection \n \n0.00 \n \n(5.00) \n \n(5.00) \nGeneral Government \n \n6.50 \n \n5.00 \n \n11.50 \nALL FUNCTIONS \n \n7.50 \n \n0.70 \n \n8.20 \nFY16/17\nFY17/18\nFY18/19\nFY19/20\nFY20/21\nFY21/22\nFY22/23\nFY23/24\nFY24/25\nFY25/26\nAll Others\n195\n212\n212\n213\n229\n226\n232\n231\n232\n233\nPublic Ways\n64\n64\n66\n71\n71\n71\n72\n72\n73\n75\nPublic Assistance\n786\n794\n761\n771\n775\n790\n818\n821\n855\n853\nHealth\n524\n544\n542\n558\n555\n546\n569\n588\n595\n596\nPublic Protection\n1,199\n1,195\n1,186\n1,198\n1,218\n1,219\n1,244\n1,234\n1,225\n1,220\nGeneral Govt\n256\n259\n263\n272\n283\n290\n295\n296\n297\n308\n0\n500\n1,000\n1,500\n2,000\n2,500\n3,000\n3,500\n3,024\n3,068\n3,030\n3,083\n3,131\n3,142\n3,229\n3,242\n3,277\n3,285\n\nPermanent Position Summary \nBill Emlen, County Administrator \n \n \n \n \nB-2 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nBackground \nHistorically, the total number of Full Time Equivalent (FTE) positions fluctuates in response to changing economic conditions and \nevolving operational requirements. Changes are often needed to adapt to federal and State legislation, especially in the areas of \nPublic Protection, Public Assistance, and Health Services. \nBelow is an overview of significant changes affecting position allocations in each fiscal year beginning with FY2020/21. \n\u2022 \nFY2020/21 reflected decreases in Health Services and the Department of Child Support Services, offset by increases in \nseveral departments related to operational changes, the LNU Fire recovery, COVID-19 response efforts, and increases \nin workload. \n\u2022 \nFY2021/22 reflected increases in General Government related to operational changes and in Social Services due to \nincreases in workload, offset by decreases in the Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) to reduce the deficit on a \ngradual basis. It also reflected increases in the Department of Information Technology due to the changing nature of \ninformation technology work. \n\u2022 \nFY2022/23 reflected increases to address operational changes, mandated programs and increased workload demands \nin the areas of public safety, mental health and health services, and public assistance. \n\u2022 \nFY2023/24 continued to reflect gradual staffing increases related to operational changes, mandated programs, and \nchanges in workload. \n\u2022 \nFY2024/25 reflected a net increase in positions required to fulfill mandated programs, mostly at the State level, where \nfunding provided was often insufficient to fund additional staff necessary to meet the increased workloads created by \nthese programs. \n\u2022 \nFY2025/26 reflects leaner increases in staffing due to budgetary uncertainties at the federal level while still addressing \noperational changes. \nAdditional information regarding the justification and funding for individual positions is included in the budget units\u2019 narrative \nsections associated with each position. This Recommended Budget was prepared prior to the release of the State\u2019s final budget \nand may require additional changes to County positions through the Midyear Financial Report and if needed, at other times during \nthe fiscal year. \nCHANGES AND TRENDS \nThe following section provides a summary of the factors that have driven position allocation changes since FY2020/21 by category. \nThe Permanent Position Summary at the back of this section provides an outline of each category, the departments in the \ncategories, and the total number of allocated positions in each department and category in each Adopted Budget since FY2020/21. \nGeneral Government \nGeneral Government, which includes departments responsible for internal County functions such as the Board of Supervisors, \nCounty Administrator, Auditor/Controller, County Counsel, General Services, and Human Resources, reflects growth to address \nincreased demand for services. Several departments, such as the Tax Collector/County Clerk, Treasurer, and Assessor, have \nautomated processes to manage increased activities and transactions, and streamline the delivery of services. This area has \nincreased its allocated positions by 25.5 FTEs since FY2020/21 at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nPublic Protection \nThe Public Protection area has seen a net increase of 2.0 FTEs since FY2020/21. The Sheriff\u2019s Office reflects a net increase of \n8.0 FTEs since FY2020/21, Probation has also seen a net increase of 8.0 FTEs since FY2020/21, and Resource Management, a \nnet increase of 7.0 FTEs since FY2020/21. These increases are primarily due to new or expanded requirements of the County \ndue to contracted or grant funded services, the staffing necessary for changes in the jail population which has been impacted by \nthe need for Administrative Separations (Ad Sep), and changes in State and federal programs/regulations. These increases are \npartially offset by significant decreases in staffing for Child Support Services, which has seen a decrease of 21.0 FTEs since \nFY2020/21, primarily related to funding from the federal and State government which has continued to remain relatively flat, \nresulting in this continuous downsizing, primarily through attrition.",

Staffing levels in Public Works are now \napproaching pre-2008 recession level. \nHealth Services \nThe Health Services category has experienced significant growth with 41.25 FTEs positions since FY2020/21. The growth is \nprimarily in Health and Social Services, Behavioral Health Division, which reflects an increase of 39.0 FTEs. Staffing in Behavioral \nHealth continues to grow steadily due to new mandates and responsibilities. Since 2022, just over 50 new State initiatives, \nprograms, or compliance mandates from new laws have been added to mental health plan requirements pertaining to the following \ncategories: new Medi-Cal benefits, program/quality reforms, children/youth behavioral health initiatives, infrastructure (treatment \nand housing), LPS/crisis continuum, housing/homelessness, Department of State Hospital coordination, mandates around equity \nand diversity planning, new Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) standardized measures that compare the \nquality of health plans in coordination with managed care plans and hospitals, coverage parity, and others. \nPublic Assistance \nThe Public Assistance category has experienced significant growth in positions since FY2020/21 with a total 77.5 FTEs since \nFY2022/21. Out of the Public Assistance position, the most growth has been seen in the Health and Social Services, Social \nServices Division with an increase of 69.50 FTEs. Public Assistance staffing continues to grow due to new mandates and \nresponsibilities, caseload increases, more stringent requirements for performance-based outcomes and quality improvement, and \nexpanded services for California\u2019s growing aging and disabled population. This is an area that will need to be monitored closely \nin light of potential federal funding reductions. \nAll Others \nAll Other staffing, which includes Education, Recreation, Department of Information Technology (DoIT), Fleet, Risk Management, \nand Airport continues to experience slow growth. This area has increased its allocated positions by 4.0 FTEs since FY2020/21. \nThis growth was primarily in Parks and Recreation and DoIT. \n \n\nPermanent Position Summary \nBill Emlen, County Administrator \n \n \n \n \nB-4 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nFY2025/26 POSITION ADDITIONS AND DELETIONS \nThe Position Allocation List is a fluid document and recommendations are subject to change based on changes to revenue, \nincluding grants, and changes in State and federal mandates.

Expirations of Limited-Term positions and other administrative actions \nare delegated to the Director of Human Resources and the County Administrator by the Board. \nThe County Administrator\u2019s FY2025/26 Recommended Budget reflects a net increase of 0.70 FTE positions. This is the net result \nof 7.50 FTE positions added during FY2024/25, 11.70 new FTE positions, the deletion of 6.0 FTE vacant positions, and 5.0 FTE \nexpiring Limited-Term positions for consideration as part of the FY2025/26 Recommended Budget.

As one of California\u2019s \noriginal 27 counties, Solano County is rich in history and offers many resources to the public and the business community. In \naddition to the unincorporated area, the County serves seven cities: Benicia, Dixon, Fairfield, Rio Vista, Suisun City, Vacaville, \nand Vallejo. Solano County is comprised of 913 total square miles, including 675 square miles of rural and farmlands, 150 square \nmiles of urban land area, including cities and unincorporated areas, and 84 square miles of water. \nThe County provides the following services: \n\u2022 Libraries (as contract services for cities) \n\u2022 Jails and Juvenile Facilities \n\u2022 Probationary Supervision \n\u2022 District Attorney \n\u2022 Public Defender and Alternative Defense \n\u2022 Grand Jury \n\u2022 Coroner and Forensic Services \n\u2022 Airport \n\u2022 Family Support Collection \n\u2022 Public Health and Behavioral Health Services \n\u2022 Dental Services \n\u2022 Indigent Medical Services \n\u2022 Child Protection and Social Services \n\u2022 Public Assistance \n\u2022 Environmental Health \n\u2022 Parks \n\u2022 Veterans Services \n\u2022 Agricultural Commissioner \n\u2022 Weights and Measures \n\u2022 U.C.

When reviewing Solano County\u2019s economic \nhealth, the County\u2019s financial capacity, and the County\u2019s \ndelivery of services to residents in unincorporated areas, \ncomparisons are provided from the current year to prior \nyears. \nAdditionally, the question of how Solano County compares \nwith other counties is often raised. This leads to the question: \nWhich counties should be used for comparison purposes? \nA group of ten counties have been selected for comparison \nin seven of the following charts. Solano County shares the \nfollowing characteristics in common with each of these \ncounties: \n\nSolano County Statistical Profile \nBill Emlen, County Administrator \n \n \n \n \nC-2 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \n\u2022 \nSimilar in population \u2013 two with higher population and eight with lower population. \n\u2022 \nA total population of more than 125,000 but less than 525,000. \n\u2022 \nAll include both suburban and rural environments. \n\u2022 \nNone contain a city with more than 300,000 in population. \n\u2022 \nSeven are coastal or Bay Area counties. \n\u2022 \nMost have similar land use challenges. \nCOUNTY POPULATION OVER TIME \nThe California Department of Finance\u2019s May 1, 2025, estimate of the population of Solano County is 449,839, decreasing by 127 \nresidents or (-0.03%) when compared to 2024 (Chart A). Of California\u2019s 58 counties, Solano County ranks number 19 in terms of \npopulation size. Three of Solano County\u2019s seven cities experienced a gain in population and four experienced a decline in \npopulation between 2024 and 2025, with the single largest percentage gain in Dixon at +566 (2.8%) and the single largest decline \nin Vallejo at -584 (or -0.5%). \nCalifornia\u2019s population estimate was 39.53 million as of May 1, 2025, a 0.3% increase from 2024, per the California Department \nof Finance. California, the nation\u2019s most populous State, represents 12% of the nation\u2019s population, or one out of every eight \npersons. Solano County\u2019s population represents 1.18% of the State population. \nWhen you look at the County population over the past 25 years, the rate of growth nearly doubled between 2010 and 2020 when \ncompared to 2000 to 2010, but then shows a very slight decrease between 2024 and 2025.

In contrast, 96% of residents in Solano County live within the County\u2019s seven cities. This phenomenon is by design. \nIn the early 1980s, the residents of the County passed an Orderly Growth Initiative, which was extended in 1994, that focuses \nmost urban growth to the incorporated cities. The voters reaffirmed this measure through the adoption of the 2008 Solano County \nGeneral Plan, sustaining a commitment to city-focused growth through 2028. \nIn comparison to its benchmark counties, Solano County is one of the smaller counties in terms of square miles of land area. \nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, Solano County consists of 913 square miles, of which 84 square miles are covered with \nwater. The San Pablo Bay, Suisun Bay, the Carquinez Straits, and the Sacramento River provide the County with natural borders \nto the south and east. Rich agricultural land lies in the northern area of the County while rolling hills make up the southern area. \nApproximately 62% of the County land area is comprised of farmland. \nThis unique mixture of a sizeable urban population and a large rural/agricultural base creates unique challenges for County \ngovernment, including: \n\u2022 \nChallenges in the transition zones between urbanized areas and agricultural areas (i.e., land use, pesticide use, dust, noise, \nodors, and vermin). \n\u2022 \nCoordination of infrastructure transitions from the urban areas to the rural areas (i.e., reliever routes, upgraded feeder \nstreets/roads, flood control, limited intercity connectivity, and public transportation). \n\u2022 \nWith limited resources and a reliance on property taxes and State and federal funding, it is a challenge to provide for urban-\ndriven needs (as indicated by the high density per square mile) for health, mental health, public assistance, and law and \njustice services. \nCHART E: COMPARISON OF LAND AREA, POPULATION DENSITY AND DISTRIBUTION IN BENCHMARK \nCOUNTIES \nTotal square miles, land, and water \nPersons per square mile \nPercent of residents living in \nunincorporated areas \nCOUNTY \nLAND \nWATER \nCOUNTY \nPERSONS \nCOUNTY \nPERCENT \nTulare \n4,826 \n15 \nSolano \n488 \nSanta Cruz \n48.6% \nMonterey \n3,323 \n449 \nSanta Cruz \n433 \nSan Luis Obispo \n42.9% \nSan Luis Obispo \n3,306 \n311 \nMarin \n305 \nSanta Barbara \n31.5% \nSanta Barbara \n2,735 \n1,052 \nPlacer \n175 \nTulare \n28.1% \nSonoma \n1,578 \n192 \nSonoma \n271 \nSonoma \n27.5% \nPlacer \n1,409 \n98 \nYolo \n219 \nPlacer \n27.4% \nYolo \n1,021 \n9 \nNapa \n162 \nMarin \n26.0% \nSolano \n829 \n84 \nSanta Barbara \n115 \nMonterey \n24.2% \nNapa \n790 \n40 \nMonterey \n115 \nNapa \n17.2% \nMarin \n519 \n308 \nTulare \n99 \nYolo \n15.9% \nSanta Cruz \n446 \n162 \nSan Luis Obispo \n78 \nSolano \n4.0% \n Source: U.S. Census Bureau, California Department of Finance, Demographic Research Unit, May 2025\n\nSolano County Statistical Profile \nBill Emlen, County Administrator \n \n \n \n \nC-6 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nSOLANO FAMILIES LIVING IN POVERTY \u2013 HOW WE COMPARE \nThe Health and Human Services Department defines the poverty threshold for an average family of four (two adults with two \nchildren) living in the United States (48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia, not including Alaska and Hawaii) as having \na median annual family income of $32,150 or less for calendar year 2025. The median annual family income for all families living \nin Solano County is $100,027. \nPer the 2019-2023 American Community Survey by the U.S. Census Bureau, the latest date the data is available, 8.1% of all \nfamilies are living at or below the federal poverty level in Solano County. This estimate compares to 10.4% of all people, 4.6% of \nmarried couples and 11.9% of people under the age of 18 living under the federal poverty level in Solano County. The poverty \nrate was the highest, estimated at 21%, among households with a female head of house with no spouse present. \nThe number of families living at or below the poverty level varies considerably among Solano County\u2019s seven cities, including \nBenicia, 5.1%; Dixon, 7.2%; Fairfield, 7.9%; Rio Vista, 3.8%; Suisun City, 6.4%; Vacaville, 6.9%, and Vallejo, 9.4%. \nSolano County is positioned seventh on the bar chart below when compared to benchmark counties, with four counties having \nhigher family poverty rates, including Santa Barbara, Yolo, Monterey, and Tulare counties; and six counties with lower family \npoverty rates, including Marin, Placer, Sonoma, Napa, San Luis Obispo, and Santa Cruz.

The \n2019-2023 American Communities Survey indicates that per capita income (the metric used to determine average per-person \nincome for an area) in Solano County in 2023 (the latest date the data is available) was $44,597. This outpaced the national \neconomy per capita income of $43,281 and is slightly lower than California\u2019s per capita income of $47,977. \nPer the 2023 statistics from the US Census, 2019-2023 American Community Survey (the latest date the data is available), Solano \nCounty ranks as the fifth lowest in per capita income when compared to the benchmark counties. Solano County\u2019s growth rate in \nper capita income increased by 4% (or $1,711) between 2022 and 2023, increasing around the same pace as most of the \nbenchmark counties. Solano County\u2019s per capita income of $44,597 in 2023 is -7.7% or $3,416 less than the State\u2019s per capita \nincome of $48,013. \nBecause the change in per capita income data lags by one year, the data collected in May 2025 has shown a slight increase in \npersonal income, as it is pulling data collected from 2022; however, data to be collected in 2026 is likely to show a leveling out \nand / or a slight decrease in personal income, as most people received some kind of government stimulus funding as part of the \nAmerican Rescue Plan Act, which likely bolstered incomes, and the next data report may include elements of inflation and tariffs. \nCHART K: CHANGE IN PER CAPITA INCOME IN BENCHMARK COUNTIES \u2013 2023 DATA \n \nSource: American Community Survey, May 1, 2025 (2023 data) \n$86,368\n$57,393\n$54,606\n$54,582\n$53,931\n$50,019\n$48,013\n$44,597\n$43,604\n$42,724\n$38,437\n$28,139\n-1.1%\n5.7%\n1.1%\n3.9%\n2.0%\n5.5%\n5.3%\n4.0%\n-2.3%\n2.4%\n1.8%\n7.1%\n-$10,000\n$0\n$10,000\n$20,000\n$30,000\n$40,000\n$50,000\n$60,000\n$70,000\n$80,000\n$90,000\n$100,000\nMarin\nNapa\nPlacer\nSonoma\nSanta Cruz\nSan Luis Obispo\nCALIFORNIA\nSolano\nSanta Barbara\nYolo\nMonterey\nTulare\nPer Capita Income 2023\nChange from Prior Year\n\nSolano County Statistical Profile \nBill Emlen, County Administrator \n \n \n \n \nC-10 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nMEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME COMPARISONS AMONG BENCHMARK COUNTIES \nMedian household income is comprised of the average income of every resident (within that household) over the age of 15. \nSources of income include personal wages and salaries, disability payments, child support payments received, along with personal \nbusiness earnings, investments, and other routine sources of income. \nThe US Census, 2019-2023 American Community Survey reports that along with per capita income, median household income \n(MHI) is a good indicator of how typical households generate and use income, including spending and savings. \nPer the 2025 statistics from the US Census, Solano County ranks as the sixth highest in MHI when compared to benchmark \ncounties. Solano County\u2019s MHI of $100,027 in 2023 is an increase of $2,990 per household (or 3.1%) over the previous year \n(2022). Even with this moderate increase, Solano County still sits in the middle of the benchmark counties when comparing MHI, \nwith five counties having a higher MHI, including Marin, Placer, Santa Cruz, Napa, and Sonoma Counties, and five counties with \na lower MHI, including Yolo, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Monterey, and Tulare Counties. Four of the benchmark counties \nexperienced a year-over-year loss in MHI, with Monterey County experiencing the highest year-over-year decrease of -3.4 percent. \nAdditionally, Solano County outperformed the State of California\u2019s MHI of $95,521 by $4,506 (or 4.6%). \nBecause the change in MHI data lags by one year, the data collected in May 2025 has shown a moderate increase in MHI for \nseven of the 10 benchmark counties, as it is pulling data collected from 2023; however, the data collected in 2025 is likely to show \na leveling out of MHI for most of the benchmark counties, as most households received American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) \nstimulus funding due to the COVID-19 pandemic health emergency. Marin County likely lost overall MHI due to the ongoing \npandemic and did not receive much ARPA funding, as most households did not qualify for stimulus funding (household income \ntoo high). \nCHART L: CHANGE IN MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN BENCHMARK COUNTIES \u2013 2023 DATA \n \nSource: 2019-2023 American Community Survey\u2013 Figures are based on 2023 inflation dollars \n$139,644\n$109,713\n$105,631\n$104,686\n$100,707\n$100,027\n$95,521\n$93,203\n$91,127\n$90,670\n$88,035\n$73,097\n-1.7%\n0.3%\n1.2%\n-1.1%\n1.4%\n3.1%\n3.9%\n9.1%\n-1.3%\n0.6%\n-3.4%\n12.1%\n-$20,000\n$0\n$20,000\n$40,000\n$60,000\n$80,000\n$100,000\n$120,000\n$140,000\n$160,000\nMarin\nPlacer\nSanta Cruz\nNapa\nSonoma\nSolano\nCalifornia\nYolo\nSanta Barbara\nSan Luis Obispo\nMonterey\nTulare\n 2023 Median Household Income\nChange from Prior Year",

Most people in the United States have private health \ninsurance, primarily through an employer, some obtain coverage through programs offered by the government, while other \nindividuals do not have health insurance at all. Being uninsured greatly influences the services they receive and escalates the \ncosts associated with accessing healthcare. There are many social determinants of health \u2013 such as access to food, housing, and \neconomic stability \u2013 that are often associated with not having health insurance. \nNationally, in 2023 (the latest date the data are available, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) 7.6% \nof people, or 25.0 million, did not have health insurance at any point during the year. Between 2022 and 2024, the total population \nfor the United States slightly increased, largely due to changes in deaths, births, and immigration rates, according to the U.S. \nCensus Bureau. \nIn California, according to the State Department of Finance, the population slightly increased between 2021 and 2023, and the \npercentage of uninsured residents decreased from 7.0% in 2021 to 6.3% in 2023. The uninsured rate in California continues to \ndecrease and more people have health insurance since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In 2013, nearly 18 \nout of 100 people did not have health insurance (17.8%); in 2023 that number dropped to around 6 out of 100 people (6.3%). \nMore people in Solano County have obtained health insurance since the ACA, from 12.9% uninsured in 2013 (51,556 people) to \n4.9% uninsured in 2023 (21,296 people), with 50.6% on employee plans, 17.2% on Medicaid, 10.9% on Medicare, 14.1% on non-\ngroup plans, and 2.36% on military or VA plans- according to the American Community Survey 2019-2023. \nDEMAND FOR PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS REMAINS HIGH \nThrough the first three quarters of FY2024/25, an average of 54,452 individuals received CalFresh each month, up 3.2% compared \nto the FY2023/24 average of 52,761. Demand for cash assistance programs has also increased through the first three quarters of \nFY2024/25. Monthly, an average of 3,485 households receive CalWORKs cash assistance, up 5.7% compared to the FY2023/24 \naverage of 3,298. Despite a 12.4% year-over-year increase in applications, General Assistance loans for indigent adults have \ndecreased by 11.7% in FY2024/25, with an average of 447 monthly recipients compared to 506 monthly recipients in FY2023/24. \nAs of March 2025, the Department of Healthcare Services reports 145,700 Solano County residents have health insurance through \nMedi-Cal, a 0.9% decrease compared to the 147,072 individuals receiving Medi-Cal in March 2024. This decrease in Medi-Cal \nenrollment was driven by the requirement to redetermine Medi-Cal eligibility for all recipients at the conclusion of the pandemic-\nera continuous coverage mandate, which has not been completed. \nCOMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT SURVEY IDENTIFIES TOP HEALTH CONCERNS \nIn 2020, Solano County Public Health commissioned a Community Health Assessment (CHA) to gather data on local health issues \nand trends. The CHA identified eight top health concerns: economic security, housing, access to care, education, violence and \ninjury prevention, behavioral health, healthy eating and active living, and maternal and infant health. This assessment informs the \nCommunity Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) and supports ongoing health improvement efforts. Public Health is currently \ndeveloping the latest version of the Community Health Assessment (CHA) in collaboration with Behavioral Health, local hospitals, \nand community partners. The final version is scheduled for release in Fall 2025, aligning with new requirements under Proposition \n1 for Behavioral Health. Next steps for Public Health include addressing the eight priority areas from the survey, sharing the CHA \nwith partners to raise awareness, developing the 2023 Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) with local collaborators, and \npursuing Public Health Accreditation. Full survey results and materials are available at www.SolanoCounty.gov/PH. \nGROWTH IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITY GROUPS \nAs of January 2024, California reported 187,084 individuals experiencing homelessness, the highest number in the nation. This \nreflects a slight increase from the 185,000 recorded in 2023. In Solano County, 1,725 people were identified as experiencing \nhomelessness in the 2024 Point in Time Count, marking a 46% increase since the last full Count in 2022. Of these, 1,436 \nindividuals were unsheltered and the majority live in Vallejo (665 unsheltered). A disabling condition\u2014often worsened by the \nexperience of homelessness\u2014can significantly limit a person\u2019s ability to secure employment and maintain stable housing. In \nSolano County, 46.7% of individuals who completed the Point-in-Time survey reported having at least one disabling condition. \nAmong them, 24% had a chronic health condition, 29% reported a mental illness, and 39% were affected by substance use \ndisorders. Older adults remain a vulnerable population: individuals aged 65 and older represented 12.1% of the sheltered",

The Moving Solano Forward (MSF) III project identifies this food-chain cluster as supporting more than 8,750 jobs and \n$1.55 billion in economic output (as of 2021, the latest date the data is available), representing approximately 7.9% of the County's \ntotal $19.73 billion-dollar Gross Regional Product. \nCHART R: 2024 ESTIMATED GROSS AGRICULTURE CROP VALUES FOR SOLANO COUNTY \n \nSource: County of Solano Agricultural Commissioner (*early estimates for the 2024 Crop Report) \n \n$259,398,000\n$291,658,300\n$342,695,000\n$348,215,000\n$378,645,000\n$334,686,000\n$347,172,000\n$362,822,000\n$363,977,000\n$372,113,000\n$357,159,000\n$407,642,000\n$390,881,000\n$460,391,000\n$410,000,000\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024\n\n \nSolano County Statistical Profile \n \nBill Emlen, County Administrator \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nC-17 \nCOUNTY ASSESSED VALUES AND GROWTH \nProperty taxes are a major source of local governmental revenues and are determined by assessed values. The annual property \ntax rate throughout the State of California is 1% of assessed values. The FY2024/25 Property Assessment Roll of over \n$73.89 billion increased 5.12% or $3.6 billion from the prior year\u2019s roll value and represents property ownership in Solano County \nas of January 1, 2024. This is the thirteenth year of increasing assessed values since the bottom of the market in 2011. The \nresidential real estate market showed steady growth over the prior year (January 1, 2023, to January 1, 2024), while new \nconstruction continues to add value to the County\u2019s property tax roll. \nAs real estate market values have risen over time, the number of properties in Proposition 8 status \u2013 which is a temporary reduction \nin a property value below the established Proposition 13 base year value \u2013 has decreased. There are currently 4,353 parcels in \nProposition 8 status. The number of parcels in Proposition 8 status peaked in 2012 at 78,000 parcels. As of June 2024, there are \ncurrently 154,505 individual parcels countywide, spread between the seven cities and unincorporated county. \nCHART S: LOCAL ASSESSED VALUES FOR SOLANO COUNTY \n \nSource: County of Solano, Assessor-Recorder\u2019s Office, June 2024 (latest data available) \n \n$32,733,946,293\n$36,839,683,379\n$41,996,188,354\n$46,137,914,928\n$45,764,370,220\n$41,317,942,381\n$39,703,866,308\n$39,084,542,084\n$39,230,406,083\n$41,009,570,674\n$44,136,703,132\n$46,432,251,450\n$49,228,876,029\n$52,156,880,577\n$55,023,155,157\n$58,019,276,877\n$60,888,053,079\n$62,693,504,984\n$66,751,358,163\n$70,286,601,060\n$73,890,220,854\n2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024",

Building permit activity can signal \nlocal growth (when increasing) or a slower local economy (when falling). Changing permits help predict changes in construction \njobs and demand for raw materials to build residential and commercial units. \nSolano County\u2019s commercial real estate building permit activity decreased in FY2023/24 compared to FY2022/23. Commercial \nconstruction decreased by over 564,000 square feet in FY2023/24 compared to 3.3 million new square feet of space between July \n2022 and June 2023 (the previous fiscal year). According to Colliers International, office-vacancy rates in Solano County \ndecreased during 2024 by 5.3% by the end of Quarter 4 2024, with rents decreasing slightly to $2.29 per square foot as 2024 \nended. \nBuilding permits for residential units in Solano County increased in FY2023/24 compared to FY2022/23, with a growth of 561 units. \nIn FY2023/24 there were 1,670 units permitted by Solano County. There were 1,109 residential building permits issued in \nFY2022/23. Interest rates have fallen slightly, but the descent has slowed down; housing prices have stabilized in Solano County, \nwhich may slow permit activity in FY2024/25. Commercial permits are also projected to have little growth from FY2023/24 in the \ncurrent fiscal year (in quarters 1 and 2 of FY2024/25, the commercial square footage permitted has increased slightly from the \nfirst two quarters of FY2023/24). \nThe chart below indicates that new-home building permits grew at a slower pace, permitting 2,779 units in the last two fiscal years. \nThe slowdown in new commercial space permitted continues to demonstrate uncertainty in some submarkets. Office rents remain \nat risk of longer durations of vacancy (Solano County\u2019s market is much larger but at about 60% of Napa County prices), with long-\nterm demand remaining a concern. Current evolving policies at the federal and state level need to be monitored in terms of how \nnew space is contemplated, especially if manufacturing regionally increases. \nCHART T: SOLANO COUNTY RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL BUILDING PERMITS, FISCAL YEARS \n2004-2005 TO 2023-2024 / COMMERCIAL SQUARE FEET AND RESIDENTIAL UNITS PERMITTED \n \nSources: (1) U.S. Census Bureau \n(2) 2024 Index of Economic and Community Progress via the County of Solano \n564,956 \n1,670 \n -\n 500\n 1,000\n 1,500\n 2,000\n 2,500\n 3,000\n 3,500\n -\n 500,000\n 1,000,000\n 1,500,000\n 2,000,000\n 2,500,000\n 3,000,000\n 3,500,000\n2004-05\n2005-06\n2006-07\n2007-08\n2008-09\n2009-10\n2010-11\n2011-12\n2012-13\n2013-14\n2014-15\n2015-16\n2016-17\n2017-18\n2018-19\n2019-20\n2020-21\n2021-22\n2022-23\n2023-24\nHousing Units\nCommerical Square Feet\nComm Sq Ft\nHousing Units\n\n \nSolano County Statistical Profile \n \nBill Emlen, County Administrator \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nC-19 \n2011 PUBLIC SAFETY REALIGNMENT AND ASSEMBLY BILL 109 \nDue to the passage of Assembly Bill 109 (AB 109, Public Safety Realignment) in October 2011, the Solano County jail population \nhas changed over time. As of March 1, 2025, the County jail was housing 24 parole violators (known as 3056 PC), 35 Post Release \nCommunity Supervision (PRCS) violators, and 35 locally sentenced offenders (known as 1170 offenders) making up approximately \none-quarter of the jail population. \nPrior to Public Safety Realignment, the County jail population consisted of individuals awaiting trial and inmates serving sentences \nof less than one year. Today, after realignment, some convicted individuals are now serving sentences up to ten years in local \ncounty jails rather than in State prisons. \nTo address the evolving inmate population resulting from AB 109, the County increased capacity within the jail system and \nincorporated training programs into the jails. Training programs, like those offered at the Rourk Vocational Training Center at the \nClaybank / Stanton Correctional Facility in Fairfield, provide offenders with additional skills to enhance their ability to successfully \nre-enter the community. Non-serious, non-violent, non-sex (non-non-non) offenders have transitioned from supervision by State \nparole officers to County probation officers. While this shift did not increase the population of supervised offenders in Solano \nCounty, it shifted the supervising agency, leaving counties to address supervision and mandated parole programs designed to \nreduce recidivism. \nCHART U: SNAPSHOT \u2013 CHANGES IN POPULATION UNDER SUPERVISION IN SOLANO COUNTY JAILS \n \nSolano County Probation \nSolano County Sheriff - Custody \nTotal \n \nPRCS \n1170h PC \nAdults \n3056 PC \n1170h PC \nPRCS \nOther \nMarch 1, 2023 \n384 \n44 \n1,711 \n29 \n28 \n40 \n436 \n2,672 \nMarch 1, 2024 \n402 \n20 \n1,735 \n27 \n24 \n23 \n420 \n2,651 \nMarch 1, 2025 \n390 \n75 \n1,742 \n24 \n35 \n35 \n406 \n2,707 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChange from 2024 \n(12) \n55 \n7 \n(3) \n11 \n12 \n(14) \n56 \n% Change \n-2.9% \n275.0% \n0.4% \n-11.1% \n45.8% \n52.2% \n-3.3% \n2.1% \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChange from 2023 \n6 \n31 \n31 \n(5) \n7 \n(5) \n(30) \n35 \n% Change \n1.6% \n70.4% \n1.8% \n-17.2% \n25.0% \n-12.5% \n-6.9% \n1.3% \nSource: 2025, Solano County Community Corrections Partnership and California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation \nAB 1950 \u2013 PROBATION, LENGTH OF TERMS \nWith the passage of Assembly Bill 1950 (AB 1950), Probation, Length of Terms in September 2020, the length of probation in both \nmisdemeanor and felony cases was shortened. Under this law, probation is capped at one year for misdemeanors and two years \nfor felonies. There are some exceptions, however: AB 1950 does not apply to financial crimes involving more than $25,000, crimes \n\u201cthat includes specific probation lengths within its provisions,\u201d and violent felonies. \nBefore AB 1950, most misdemeanor offenses were punishable by three years of probation, and most felony offenses were \npunishable by five years of probation. This meant that people could be sent to jail for probation violations years after they were \nconvicted of a crime, and because there are numerous ways to violate probation, many people were arrested or sentenced to \nadditional jail time for doing so. However, because AB 1950 reduces the amount of time someone is on probation, people are less \nlikely to violate their probation and return to jail. In Solano County, the Probation Department has seen a reduction in the number \nof adult probationers (also known as Formal Supervision cases) as a direct result of the implementation of AB 1950.",

As illustrated in the chart above, over the next thirteen and one-half years, the average daily jail population grew and \ncontracted several times. The largest contraction took place between late February and early March 2020, which is a result of \nemergency measures taken by the State, local courts, and the Sheriff to address increased concerns regarding the COVID-19 \npandemic emergency and the associated medical risks of contracting the virus. \nThe long-term pre-COVID-19 decrease in the County\u2019s jail population (jail population peaking in 2016) can be attributed to many \nfactors, including an increase in pre-trial releases; split sentencing by the Courts, reducing time served; implementation of the \nHumphrey Decision (January 2018), whereby judges may consider offender\u2019s ability to post bail and when appropriate, reduce \nbail amounts; bail alternatives; and the reduction of leased jail beds (March 2018). The Solano County Sheriff continues to see an \nincrease in the number of inmates requiring Administrative Separation (AdSep). Inmates requiring AdSep are more prone to disrupt \njail operations and therefore placed in a cell by themselves \u2013 a cell that would normally house two inmates. \n \n \n\n \nSolano County Statistical Profile \n \nBill Emlen, County Administrator \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nC-21 \nPrincipal Taxpayers with over $50,000,000 in Assessed Value for FY2024-25 \nPrincipal Property Tax Payers \n \nParcels \n \nAssessed Value \n \nTotal Taxes \nKAISER FOUNDATION HOSPITALS \n \n5 \n \n$1,472,137,654 \n \n$1,173,674 \nPACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY \n \n5 \n \n$1,171,164,378 \n \n$20,461,240 \nVALERO REFINING COMPANY CALIF \n \n28 \n \n$875,580,450 \n \n$10,480,981 \nGENENTECH INC \n \n27 \n \n$761,439,017 \n \n$8,949,740 \nANHEUSER-BUSCH COMM STRAT LLC \n \n2 \n \n$331,365,430 \n \n$3,817,407 \nNORTHBAY HEALTHCARE GROUP \n \n11 \n \n$306,964,093 \n \n$1,021,914 \nFLANNERY ASSOCIATES LLC \n \n307 \n \n$271,371,949 \n \n$3,061,273 \nMPLD VACAVILLE C LLC \n \n1 \n \n$251,766,380 \n \n$2,952,850 \nSTAR-WEST SOLANO LLC \n \n7 \n \n$209,066,247 \n \n$2,492,411 \nPW FUND A LP \n \n8 \n \n$185,511,534 \n \n$2,257,238 \nINVITATION HOMES INC \n \n412 \n \n$170,451,331 \n \n$2,213,329 \nICON OWNER POOL 1 SF N-B P LLC \n \n28 \n \n$154,850,044 \n \n$1,855,805 \nNOVA AT GREEN VALLEY LP \n \n1 \n \n$150,177,620 \n \n$1,778,296 \nCSCDA COMM IMPROVEMENT AUTHORITY \n \n2 \n \n$143,001,600 \n \n$1,600,769 \nREEP-IND STANFORD COURT CA LLC \n \n1 \n \n$142,534,800 \n \n$1,519,415 \nCORDELIA WINERY LLC \n \n22 \n \n$141,522,359 \n \n$1,636,143 \nNELLA NT, LLC \n \n10 \n \n$129,829,788 \n \n$1,749,233 \nSACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTIL DIST \n \n1 \n \n$124,617,580 \n \n$1,345,870 \nCPG FINANCE II LLC \n \n3 \n \n$120,554,324 \n \n$1,616,310 \nSHILOH IV WIND PROJECT LLC \n \n1 \n \n$118,688,464 \n \n$1,281,835 \nCOLONY STARWOOD HOMES \n \n284 \n \n$118,418,777 \n \n$1,527,963 \nSHILOH WIND PROJECT II LLC \n \n1 \n \n$115,647,547 \n \n$1,248,994 \nTGA MIDWAY DIST CENTER LLC \n \n1 \n \n$114,964,200 \n \n$1,384,002 \nSHILOH WIND PROJECT III LLC \n \n1 \n \n$114,711,718 \n \n$1,238,887 \nGATEWAY 80 OWNER LP \n \n4 \n \n$111,551,895 \n \n$1,364,406 \nTHE NIMITZ GROUP \n \n102 \n \n$101,322,894 \n \n$2,700,850 \nMEYER COOKWARE INDUSTRIES INC \n \n7 \n \n$100,099,940 \n \n$1,183,413 \nTRAVIS WAY LLC \n \n1 \n \n$97,373,012 \n \n$1,146,082 \nPARK MANAGEMENT CORP \n \n2 \n \n$96,819,921 \n \n$1,302,174 \nMG NORTH POINTE APARTMENTS LLC \n \n2 \n \n$95,850,126 \n \n$1,140,768 \nRANGER NORTHBAY LLC \n \n2 \n \n$93,916,907 \n \n$1,134,314 \nCA COMM HOUSING AGENCY \n \n1 \n \n$93,228,200 \n \n$1,043,602 \nTAL GREEN VALLEY LP \n \n4 \n \n$92,310,000 \n \n$1,067,013 \nCENTRO WATT PROPERTY OWNER II \n \n8 \n \n$91,243,546 \n \n$1,249,487 \nAPS WEST COAST INC \n \n27 \n \n$87,367,309 \n \n$1,043,200 \nNEXTERA ENERGY MONTZMA II WIND \n \n1 \n \n$81,041,303 \n \n$875,246 \nARDAGH METAL BEVERAGE USA INC \n \n1 \n \n$80,898,121 \n \n$856,669 \nNORTH BAY LOGISTICS OWNER LLC \n \n1 \n \n$77,998,787 \n \n$892,185 \nBRIDGE WF II CA 766 SUNSET LLC \n \n1 \n \n$75,029,651 \n \n$870,674 \nTLUS SP SUISUN OWNER, LLC \n \n1 \n \n$72,828,000 \n \n$856,756 \nBALL METAL BEVERAGE CONT CORP \n \n3 \n \n$71,229,700 \n \n$756,362 \nWRPV XIII BV VALLEJO LLC \n \n2 \n \n$70,578,749 \n \n$1,079,245 \nPW FUND B LP \n \n12 \n \n$69,663,113 \n \n$820,805 \nPRIME ASCOT LP \n \n282 \n \n$68,873,620 \n \n$1,440,311",

A key priority is \nfinancially supporting the Goals, Strategic Objectives and departmental activities consistent with the Plan. \nFollowing is a description of each of the Strategic Plan\u2019s Goals: \nGoal: Improve the health and well-being of those who live and work here \nThe County will encourage healthy, active lifestyles by promoting change toward wellness through healthy programs, partnering \nwith schools, hospitals and cities, early intervention with children and families, providing for access to services including health \ncare, dental care and mental health, and assisting our vulnerable including seniors, children and the disabled. As a large employer, \nthe County will continue to model the importance of health and wellness throughout its workforce. \nGoal: Ensure responsible and sustainable land use \nThe County, working with the cities, education, workforce training and business leaders, non-profit providers and interested \ncitizens will encourage environmentally friendly building and business activities that helps create a high quality of life in Solano \nCounty. \nThe County General Plan was updated and approved by the voters in 2008. The implementation of the various components of the \nGeneral Plan is still ongoing, including working on plans for the protection of Travis Air Force Base, an updated Housing Element, \npromotion of long-term viability of agriculture, and groundwater and water resource management. \nGoal: Maintain a safe community \nThe County and its partners will offer services, programs and projects that move from incarceration to an integrated approach \naimed at eliminating recidivism and reducing the growing need for jail beds. Programs on gang prevention, methamphetamine \nprevention, juvenile and adult recidivism, emphasizing education and training, positive parenting and restorative justice as parts \nof the integrated systems approach. Emergency preparedness will continue to play a key role in maintaining a safe community. \nGoal: Invest in and for the future \nFocused both internally and externally, work efforts involve customer service training and continuous quality improvement, survey \nand focus groups, succession planning, employee training and development, technology investment and financing of capital \nprojects and renewal efforts to ensure access to services in the future. \nBUDGET GOALS AND OBJECTIVES \nThe County Budget sets forth the foundation for major Board policy actions and provides a fiscal \u201croad map\u201d for the direction of \nCounty government to follow, now and in the future. As such, the County Budget represents the single most important document \nthat is prepared, reviewed and approved on an annual basis. It is the document that reflects the County\u2019s fiscal commitment to the \nStrategic Plan, its goals and objectives through programs and services as well as updated priorities. \nThe intent of the Budget document is to: \n\u2022 \nProvide a document in a format that is user friendly and readable in order to give the public a clear understanding of County \ngovernment operations and funding. The County Statistical Profile gives the reader a comprehensive profile of the County. \n\u2022 \nIdentify the strategic goals and objectives upon which budget allocations are made and to measure the progress of County \ndepartments and operations in fulfilling their departmental goals and objectives as well as the County\u2019s overall mission. \n\u2022 \nProvide the Board and the public with a clear understanding of revenues and appropriations in the areas of strategic \nimportance to the County, such as public safety and health and social services. \nThe basic principles, goals, and objectives of the Board of Supervisors for Solano County have been maintained as the underlying \nfoundation for the Budget. These include: \n\u2022 \nThe Budget must be balanced with appropriations equaling the combined total of estimated revenues, Fund Balance and/or \nreserves.",

Consideration will be given during Budget \nHearings to increase Assigned General Fund Balances, such as the General Fund Balances for Accrued Leave Payoff, \nPension 115 Trust/CalPERS Reserve, and for Deferred Maintenance/Capital Renewal, from available year-end Fund Balance \nwhenever the Balance is in excess of the incoming fiscal year\u2019s financing needs. \nBUDGET POLICIES OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS \nIn addition to the legally required duties, there are certain actions to implement the budget process which the Board may take, \nincluding: \n\u2022 \nChanging the arrangement of information on budget forms, upon approval of the State Controller. (Government Code \u00a729005) \n\u2022 \nInclusion of other data, in addition to presenting the minimum information on available financing and financing requirements \nas submitted by the departments in their estimates.

Sections 2-40 through 2-47 \nspecifically address the duties of the County Administrator. Section 2-45 delineates the County Administrator\u2019s role in budgetary \nmatters. These duties include: \n\u2022 \nDevelop budget instructions and policies, revenue estimates and departmental budget targets to guide departments in budget \npreparations. \n\u2022 \nRecommend to the Board an annual County operating budget based on revenue projections, budget targets and proposed \nwork programs and projects developed by the various departments. \n\u2022 \nRecommend to the Board a capital budget based upon long-range plans for acquiring, constructing or improving buildings, \nroads and other County facilities. \n\u2022 \nRecommend to the Board the acquisition and disposition of real property, except for County roads, easements and rights-of-\nway, which shall be the responsibility of the Director of Resource Management. \n\u2022 \nEstablish a control system or systems to ensure the various County departments and other agencies under the jurisdiction of \nthe Board are operating within their respective budgets. \n\u2022 \nRecommend requests to the Board for unforeseen and unbudgeted expenditures. \n\u2022 \nApprove fund transfers and budget revisions within appropriations. \n\u2022 \nRecommend to the Board fund transfer requests requiring Board action under State law. \n\u2022 \nEstablish policies for acquiring additional or replacement capital assets. \n\u2022 \nKeep the Board informed of the financial status of the County and of other matters of major significance to the County. \nBUDGET AND FISCAL POLICIES FOR FY2025/26 \nBudget Policy \n1. \nGeneral Fund Emphasis: Pending the outcome of actual Year-End Fund Balance, departments\u2019 budgets should be prepared \nwith a goal that the FY2025/26 Net County Cost or General Fund (GF) Contribution to programs will not exceed their \nFY2024/25 Midyear projection where possible and have no new programs or positions unless revenue-offset. \n2. \nLabor Costs: The County completed negotiations with all labor units in FY2022/23. No assumptions regarding labor \ncompensation resulting from future labor negotiations have been included in the FY2025/26 Recommended Budget. CalPERS \nemployer rates for FY2025/26 are expected to increase due to lower than anticipated annual investment returns in FY2022/23. \nWith continued rate increases anticipated into the future, departments should continue to pursue efficiencies in the delivery \nof services, search for opportunities to automate, streamline services where feasible, share back office operations, and \neliminate vacant non- \u201cMission Critical\u201d positions where feasible. A \u201cMission Critical\u201d position is defined as \u201ca position that \nprovides essential life, safety and/or public health services to the community or required to be filled by the County to avoid \nliability and to limit impairment or disruption to the delivery of mandated services.\u201d \n3. \nContributions to Outside Organizations: The Budget should not include contributions to outside organizations not controlled \nby the Board, such as the State Courts, unless the organization is carrying out a priority of the Board based on the community\u2019s \nneeds.",

The goal is to give the Board as much flexibility as possible in allocating \nresources to local priorities, including the Goals and Objectives outlined in the County Strategic Plan. To the extent allowed \nby law, existing programs or activities should be funded with dedicated funding sources. This will free up scarce discretionary \nresources to fund Board priorities. \n5. \nPursuit of New Revenues: Pursue additional revenue sources to the fullest extent possible for all services; and, for fee-setting \npurposes, identify total cost (including indirect costs) to enable full recovery of all costs associated with the service provided \nwhen allowed by law and economic/market considerations. \n6. \nDiscretionary Programs: Do not recommend new discretionary programs unless the programs are stated Board priorities, \noffset by savings or efficiencies creating capacity for the new program, or are fully funded by non-General Fund sources in \nFY2025/26 and will continue to be in future years. Seek legislative relief or reform for programs when feasible to facilitate \nservice outcomes over prescribed processes and procedures. \n7. \nPursue Operational Efficiencies: Explore reducing expenditures and maximizing revenues through automation and moving \ntoward self-help service delivery where feasible, consolidation of functions and streamlining of County operations. \n8. \nCounty Share: If State or federal funding is reduced, there should be no increased County share for programs funded primarily \nfrom non-General Fund sources, unless increased County share is mandated, or the program is a high priority for the Board \nof Supervisors, and the amounts are feasible in light of the County\u2019s fiscal situation. \n9. \nPosition Control: To address the changing needs of an organization, previously allocated positions may be moved between \ndepartmental divisions, with County Administrator\u2019s approval, resulting in a net change of zero Full Time Equivalent (FTE) \nwithin the department. Any movement of positions between programs and funding sources must be pre-approved by the \nCounty Administrator to avoid unintended strain on limited funding sources. \nFund Balance Policy \nOn February 13, 2007, the Board adopted a policy on the General Fund Reserve. On June 14, 2011, the Board approved changes \nto the General Fund Reserve Policy to conform to Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 54, Fund \nBalance Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Definitions. While the changes primarily affect reporting and not budgeting, \nchanges in terminology are notable. \nThe General Fund Reserve and Other Designations Policy was updated and renamed Fund Balance Policy. The classifications \nfor governmental funds of designations, reserves and unreserved/undesignated were replaced by the five categories of non-\nspendable, restricted, committed, assigned and unassigned. \nExamples of these five categories of Fund Balance are: \na. \nNon-spendable: Long-term loans \nb. \nRestricted: Public Facilities Fees \nc. \nCommitted: Public Art \nd. \nAssigned: General Fund Contribution to other funds \ne. \nUnassigned: Residual net Fund Balance \nOn March 11, 2025 the Board approved changes to the General Fund Reserve as part of the Fund Balance Policy. Key provisions \nof the Board\u2019s updated Fund Balance Policy include: \nThe General Fund General Reserve will be maintained at a target level equal to two to three months, or 16.7-25% of General \nFund operating revenues, with a minimum balance of $20 million at all times. The current reserve is $49.5 million which is currently \n80.4% of the target Reserve of $61.5 million. This level will be maintained to provide the County with sufficient working capital and \na comfortable margin to support one-time costs for the following purposes: \n\u2022 \nWhen the County faces economic recession/depression and the County must take budget action. \n\u2022 \nWhen the County is impacted by a natural disaster or any other emergency.",

In accordance with GASB \n54, this Reserve has been renamed as General Fund Balance for Accrued Leave Payoff. The purpose of this Fund Balance is to \nminimize the fiscal impact of employee retirements on County departments\u2019 budgets. These funds are to be used for large \nemployee payoffs upon retirement or employment separation from the County when the respective department has insufficient \nappropriations during the fiscal year to fund these payoffs. The following criteria and procedures were approved by the Board for \nmanaging the General Fund Balance for Accrued Leave Payoff: \n1. \nMinimum General Fund Balance for Accrued Leave Payoff. On an annual basis, the Auditor-Controller shall calculate the \nprojected leave payout requirements for the subsequent five years, net of federal and State reimbursements, and provide the \ninformation to the County Administrator\u2019s Office for inclusion in the following year\u2019s Recommended Budget. The Board\u2019s policy \nis to maintain General Fund Balance for Accrued Leave Payoff equal to 40% of the five-year projected leave payout \nrequirements net of State and federal reimbursements, with a minimum of $2 million balance maintained at all times. \n2. \nReplenishing General Fund Balance for Accrued Leave Payoff. In circumstances where the General Fund Balance for \nAccrued Leave Payoff has fallen below the established requirement, the County shall replenish the deficiency within three \nfiscal years or as soon as economic conditions allow from the following revenue sources: year-end surpluses, non-recurring \nrevenues, or if legally permissible and with a defensible rational, from excess resources in other funds. \n3. \nAnticipated Accrued Leave Payoffs. During the budget process, a General Fund department or a department that receives a \nGeneral Fund Contribution should determine the amount needed to cover anticipated Accrued Leave Payoffs for the upcoming \nyear and include the amount in their budget and work with the County Administrator\u2019s Office (CAO) to determine the funding \nstrategy to include the appropriate amount in the Recommended Budget. Strategies may be: \na. \nIf the department has sufficient appropriations to fund the Accrued Leave Payoff, the department shall absorb the cost. \nb. \nIf the department cannot absorb the cost, the department must work with the CAO to determine the funding source(s) to \noffset the increased costs. Funding from the General Fund Balance for Accrued Leave Payoff may serve as a resource \nto provide the affected department with the General Fund share of the employee payoff. \nc. \nThe General Fund share of the estimated Accrued Leave Payoff will be appropriated in the General Expenditures budget \nduring the budget process. This appropriation will be funded from the General Fund Balance for Accrued Leave Payoff. \nd. \nThe CAO is authorized to make necessary budget adjustments to the affected department(s) without Board approval up \nto the amount appropriated in 3. c. above.",

During the budget year, departments may have employees retire/terminate that were \nnot factored in the Accrued Leave Payoff calculation. Departments should consult with the CAO to determine the most \nappropriate funding strategy. \na. \nGeneral Fund departments or departments that receive a General Fund Contribution should determine if sufficient \nappropriations are available in their budget to absorb the payoff, and, if not, work with the CAO to determine the \nappropriate level of funding from the General Fund Balance for Accrued Leave Payoff as indicated above in 3. c. If \nthere are insufficient appropriations in General Expenditures Accrued Leave Payoff the CAO may recommended the use \nof the General Fund Contingency to fund the costs. Use of General Fund Contingency requires a 4/5 vote of the Board. \nb. \nNon-General Fund departments or departments that do not receive General Fund Contributions will need to determine if \ntheir respective program has sufficient appropriations or contingencies to support the Accrued Leave Payoff and should \nadjust their budget accordingly at Midyear, if necessary. If their respective program does not have sufficient \nappropriations or contingencies to support the Accrued Leave Payoff, the department(s) should work with the CAO to \ndetermine the appropriate funding strategy. \nContingency Policy \nOn March 11, 2025, the Board approved a revision to the General Fund Contingency policy to require a fixed range of between \n$10 and $25 million in the General Fund. This range allows staff to recommend and establish a Contingency level during the \nannual budget process based on current expectations and knowledge of potential unavoidable expenditures. The current \nrecommendation from staff for FY2025/26 is to fund the General Fund Contingency at $14 million, which reflects no change from \nFY2024/25. The final amount will be determined by close out of the Budget reconciliation. Appropriations for Contingencies are \nlegal authorizations granted by the Board to be used for one-time unexpected needs that arise outside of the regular budget \nplanning process. Pursuant to Government Code \u00a729130, access to the Appropriation for Contingency requires a 4/5 vote of the \nBoard of Supervisors. \nInvestment Policy \nThe County maintains an Investment Pool managed by the Treasurer/Tax Collector/County Clerk. The Investment Pool acts as a \ndepository for funds from over 80 units of local government, including funds of the county school districts, special districts and \nother entities. \nAmounts deposited in the Investment Pool are invested in accordance with investment policy guidelines established by the County \nTreasurer and approved by the Board. \nThe primary objectives of the Policy are: \n\u2022 \nSafety - Maintain the security of principal. \n\u2022 \nLiquidity - Ensure adequate liquidity to meet its cash flow needs for pool participants. \n\u2022 \nYield - Generate returns commensurate with the inherent risks being managed. \nThe Policy addresses the soundness of financial institutions in which the County deposits funds, types of investment instruments \nas permitted by Government Code \u00a753601, and the percentage of the portfolio that may be invested in certain instruments with \nlonger maturity. \nDebt Policy \nThe County Administrator\u2019s Office maintains a Debt Advisory Committee, consisting of the Assistant County Administrator and/or \nBudget Officer, Auditor/Controller, and Treasurer/Tax Collector/County Clerk. The Committee provides analyses and \nrecommendations through the County Administrator for policy implementation and oversight. \nThe County establishes fund accounts to manage and budget resources for the payment of interest and principal for general long-\nterm debt. The County also incurs debt when prudent to reduce future costs, such as pension obligation bonds. \n\nBudget Construction & Legal Requirements \n \n \n \n \n \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nD-9 \nConditions for debt issuance are as follows: \n\u2022 \nPurpose and Use of Debt - long-term General Fund debt will be incurred based on the County\u2019s needs and ability to repay, \nand where appropriate, methods and sources of funding will be maximized. Long-term debt will be restricted to those capital \nimprovements that cannot be funded from current revenues. \n\u2022 \nTypes of Debt - includes General Obligation Bonds, Revenue Bonds, Certificates of Participation, Commercial Paper, Lease-\nPurchase Agreements and other obligations. \n\u2022 \nProject Life - debt shall not exceed the useful life of the asset being acquired or constructed. \n\u2022 \nRefunding Policies - the County maintains a debt structure that allows for early retirement of debt. \nRestrictions on debt issuance include: \n\u2022 \nThe use of debt to fund operating costs or projects associated with operating costs are prohibited. \n\u2022 \nShort-term debt will not be used to finance long-term debt. \nDebt service limitations include: \n\u2022 \nDebt is a policy decision which requires a financial condition analysis that incorporates economic trends, benchmark studies, \nand all other forces impacting the future finances of the County. \n\u2022 \nAnalysis of debt burden is measured, but not limited to, the following ratios: \n\uf0a7 \nDebt service requirements as a percentage of General Fund Revenue. \n\uf0a7 \nDebt service as a percentage of Per Capita Income. \n\uf0a7 \nDebt service as a percentage of General Fund Expenditures. \nIn addition to the policy above, Government Code \u00a729909 states the total amount of bonded indebtedness shall not at any time \nexceed 5% of the taxable property of the County as shown by the last equalized assessment roll. \nResource Reduction Strategy \nIn the event reductions in resources in any fiscal year require actions to balance the Budget, in 2007, the Board of Supervisors \napproved certain Resource Reduction Strategies intended to guide the County including the following: \n1. \nGeneral Philosophy \na. \nTo the extent possible, across-the-board reductions in expenditures will be avoided. Reductions will be made on a case-\nby-case basis. The emphasis will be on conserving General Fund discretionary resources to finance high priority \nprograms, as set forth in the Solano County Strategic Plan adopted by the Board on December 11, 2007, and as further \ndefined by the Board annually. If necessary, funding for lower priority programs will be reduced or eliminated to ensure \nappropriations remain in balance with resources; \nb. \nThe County administers a number of costly State programs that are heavily funded by State and federal dollars. \nCompared to the State and federal governments, the County has only limited ability to raise revenues. Recognizing that, \nin the event of a substantial reduction in resources for these programs, the County\u2019s goal, to the extent legally possible, \nis to avoid back-filling reductions in State and federal dollars with County discretionary dollars; \nc. \nMaintaining a highly professional service delivery system is of foremost importance to the County. Thus, if it becomes \nnecessary to make significant service delivery reductions, the goal will be to reduce the quantity of a service provided \nrather than the quality of service; and \nd. \nFinally, every effort will be made to continue capital and planning programs geared toward meeting the County\u2019s long-\nterm needs.",

The purpose of these actions is to achieve immediate savings and/or better position the County to deal with \nthe impact of longer-term actions once they are implemented. \ni. \nA Selective Hiring process will be implemented. Funding sources, Board priorities, the nature of the program, the \npotential for service delivery disruption, and the type of position \u2013i.e., is it \u201cMission Critical?\u201d will be considered by \nthe CAO in implementing the hiring process. \nii. \nImplementation of new programs, not fully operational, that are not fully revenue-offset, will be subject to further CAO \nreview and recommendation to the Board. \niii. Purchase of equipment will be selectively deferred and reviewed annually. Funding source and impact on service \ndelivery will be considered in implementing the deferral. \niv. Voluntary Time Off (VTO) is available to employees only during periods designated by the Board of Supervisors as \ntimes of economic hardship. Under this program, the department head may grant a permanent employee voluntary \ntime off with the right to return to the same position according to the provisions outlined in the policy. The employee \nwill be granted VTO in the form of personal unpaid leave of absence without pay as an alternative method of reducing \nCounty costs. \nb. \nLong-Term Actions \nThe following actions will be considered when dealing with the longer-term impact of a significant reduction in resources. \nAs appropriate, these reductions will be reflected in the Recommended Budget, and/or Midyear or Third Quarter budget \nadjustments. The actions are listed in priority order and lower priority actions will be implemented only if higher priority \nactions are insufficient to deal with the fiscal shortfall: \ni. \nGeneral Fund discretionary contributions to certain programs that are primarily the State\u2019s responsibility will be \ncapped at current levels, to the extent legally possible. Except as required by law, the County will not use General \nFund dollars to backfill reductions in State or federal funding for these programs. \nii. \nA moratorium will be placed on implementing new programs or expanding existing programs if the cost of those \nprograms or expansions is not fully revenue-offset and a secure long-term funding source is not identified. \niii. Moderate service level reductions will be proposed on a case-by-case basis. These service level reductions will \nfocus first on reducing General Fund support for those programs that have not been identified as a high priority by \nthe Board. \niv. Discretionary resources that have been earmarked by the Board for certain purposes will be proposed for re-\nallocation to fund on-going programs that are a priority for the Board. \nv. \nGeneral Fund support to outside agencies not controlled by the Board should be greatly reduced or eliminated. This \nrefers to the use of General Fund to support outside agencies whose programs are not aligned with Board priorities, \nand/or the County has determined would not be provided directly by the County. \nvi. Major program reductions will be proposed in accordance with the Solano County Strategic Plan and the general \nphilosophy described above. These reductions will fall into two general categories: \n\uf0a7 \nProgram reductions that will be made in response to significant reductions in State funding for programs that \nare primarily the State\u2019s responsibility. In this case, the County will consider returning responsibility to the State \nfor operating those programs to the extent permitted by law. Where returning responsibility to the State is not \nlegally possible, County General Fund support for these programs will be reduced to the minimum level possible, \nconsistent with State mandate requirements. \n\uf0a7 \nProgram reductions will be proposed in response to a reduction in County discretionary revenue. In this case, \nreductions will be made first in those programs that are not related to the Board\u2019s priorities and goals.",

      "text": "Budget Construction & Legal Requirements \n \n \n \n \n \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nD-11 \nHiring Policy-Past Actions by the Board of Supervisors \nIn FY2010/11, a Selective Hiring Freeze process was instituted to help contain costs due to the State\u2019s continuing budget shortfall \nand to help balance the County\u2019s Budget. The County Administrative Officer (CAO) was authorized to selectively fill vacant \npositions based on the affected department\u2019s need and the particular position\u2019s function. Authorization to recruit for vacant \npositions was reviewed in terms of the definition of \u201cMission Critical\u201d positions presented to the Board on October 4, 2011 and was \nfurther defined in June 2013. \nDue to increasing salaries and employee benefits costs associated for current and new positions authorized to meet mandates \nand Board approved promotions, the County Administrator recommends to the Board that the County continues a hiring policy \nthat requires the CAO to review all permanent, limited-term, part-time, and extra-help positions when they become vacant to see \nif they should be retained and rehired with new employees. Departments will have to demonstrate a critical need in operations \nand funding strategies to the CAO for any new additional positions to be added during the fiscal year. \n1. \nDuration \nThis Policy will be in effect for FY2025/26 and until the State and federal budgets and fiscal policies and their impacts on the \nCounty are known, and a long-term plan to address those impacts addressing the remaining structural deficit in the General \nFund has been accomplished, is formulated, and/or approved by the Board. \n2. \nGoal of Hiring Process \nThe goal of this Policy is to contain costs and to provide clear direction for hiring and implementing staffing reductions, if \nnecessary. \n3. \nHiring Guidelines \nThe County Administrator\u2019s approval is required to fill new departmental position requests. In evaluating whether to fill a \nvacant position, departments are to consider the following which will be reviewed by the CAO: \na. \nIs the position critical to the operation of an essential public safety activity, such that not filling the position will put the \nlives, health or safety of residents or other staff at risk? Is the position critical to avoid liability and limit impairment or \ndisruption to the delivery of mandated services? If the answer is yes to both questions, the position can be considered \nfor approval. \nb. \nIs the program that the position supports funded on an ongoing basis by a dedicated and assured revenue source? Is \nthe position unique to that program? If the answer is yes to both these questions, then, absent other considerations, the \nposition can be advanced. \ni. \nA position is considered unique to a program when the classification is not located in any other department or \nprogram. Examples might be Librarians or Engineers. In this context, an Office Assistant would not be a unique \nposition, because this classification is found in many different programs and, in the event of the potential need to \neliminate filled positions, an Office Assistant could be transferred from one program to another within the County \norganization. \nii. \nBefore consideration will be given to a position that meets the stated criteria, departments should evaluate whether \nthe resources involved could instead be used to help mitigate the impact on the County of revenue reductions in \nother areas. \nc. \nIf a position is not filled, is the resulting reduction of services for a program below a legally mandated level? If the answer \nis yes, the position can be considered, but subject to the following: \ni. \nThe department should first explore obtaining a waiver of any service level mandate or the feasibility of ending the \nprogram or returning responsibility for the program to the State. \nii. \nTo the extent practical, efforts should be made to fill the position using the call-back of a laid-off County employee \nformerly serving in the same classification, or extra-help or through internal recruitment. \nd. \nIf a position is not filled, is the result a diminished service level where, in the department\u2019s judgment, the program\u2019s \neffectiveness is seriously compromised? If the answer is yes, the department should further consider the following:",

To provide these service needs, the County\u2019s budget is linked to the State and federal budgets as \nwell as the nation\u2019s economy. \nThis Board remains committed to meeting its operational requirements in the present term while also considering the road ahead. \nIn April 2023, the Board conducted a priority-setting workshop and identified its highest priorities for the coming years. These \npriorities included looking for efficiencies internally while also seeking the opportunities to promote economic development, boost \naffordable housing projects, grow our workforce, as well as promote and protect one of our largest economic drivers \u2013 agriculture. \nIt is currently expected that the federal administration will release a fiscal year (FY) 2026 budget proposal in mid-May. The federal \nbudget is expected to propose spending cuts that will have a wide-ranging impact on county budgets, services and the residents \nthey serve, particularly in the areas of healthcare, social services, and public safety. Furthermore, any cuts proposed by the federal \nadministration will have significant impacts on State revenues. Through this time of uncertainty, the Board is committed to \nremaining fiscally prudent and will continue to utilize Board adopted budget strategies which include: not using General Fund \ndollars to backfill reductions in State or federal funding, not implementing new programs that are not fully revenue-offset, and \nmoderating service level reductions on a case-by-case basis. \nThe Board\u2019s responsibilities include: \n\u2022 \nApprove a balanced budget for all operations of County government, including general government, public protection, public \nassistance, health and sanitation, and recreation. \n\u2022 \nEnact ordinances and resolutions which may apply to the entire County or only to unincorporated areas (not under the \njurisdiction of a city or town). \n\u2022 \nDetermine land use zoning and policy for the unincorporated area of the County through the preparation and implementation \nof a voter-approved General Plan and enabling ordinances. \n\u2022 \nEstablish salary and benefits for employees. \n\u2022 \nApprove additions/deletions to the County\u2019s position allocation list. \n\u2022 \nDirect and control litigation. \n\u2022 \nApprove contracts and appropriate funds. \n\u2022 \nAcquire and sell property. \n\u2022 \nAct as the final arbiter of decisions made by commissions and committees appointed by and serving the Board. \n\u2022 \nRepresent the County of Solano on other County, Regional and State boards, and commissions.",

This marks Supervisor James\u2019s first budget \nnarrative submission. At the time of this submission, the District 1 Office operates out of its primary location in the Solano County \nAdministrative Center at 675 Texas Street, Suite 6500, in Fairfield, CA. Efforts are currently underway to secure accessible office \nspace within the district to enhance its service to constituents. The District 1 Office budget supports the expenditures associated \nwith the elected Supervisor as well as two full-time staff members, Tony Stewart and Yuritzi Jacobo Martinez. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nSupervisor Cassandra James has been appointed or assigned to serve on 15 regional, county, and state committees, in a capacity \nof either the primary or alternate member. In parallel, the District 1 Office has actively engaged in the general onboarding process \nto increase its knowledge of county procedures and operational protocols. \nSupervisor James holds several key local roles that directly impact her constituents. She serves as a Board Director for the East \nVallejo Fire District, guiding initiatives related to public safety; Trustee for the Vallejo Flood and Wastewater District, where she \noversees vital infrastructure and management efforts; and a Member of the Vallejo Interagency Committee, where she has the \nopportunity to foster collaboration among local agencies and elected officials to address shared community priorities. \nPriorities and Accomplishments: \n\u2022 \nAs an alternate member of the Community Action Partnership (CAP) Solano Joint Powers Authority, expanding the definition \nand availability of affordable housing remains a top priority for Supervisor Cassandra James. In collaboration with the United \nWay of the Greater Bay Area, Supervisor James co-hosted the Solano County Homelessness Convening, bringing together \nkey partners to address and identify actionable solutions to homelessness in the region. During the convening, the UCSF \nBenioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative presented the Encampment Resolution Guide and committed to supporting \nSolano County in the implementation of its strategies. Additionally, at no cost to the county budget, Supervisor James authored \nletters of support for two housing projects competing for Homekey+ funding, reinforcing her commitment to advancing housing \nsolutions for the most vulnerable residents of District 1 and Solano County. \n\u2022 \nUpon seeing the new Vallejo City Council\u2019s commitment towards pursuing a short-term contract with the Sheriff\u2019s Office for \npolice services, Supervisor Cassandra James acted decisively, working directly with the Mayor of Vallejo to address the issue \nin a public forum, ensuring accountability. Recognizing the pressing need for effective violence prevention, she has partnered \nwith Californians for Safety to place Solano County at the forefront of developing and implementing critical safety strategies. \nSupervisor James has also hosted the Community Violence Initiative Network (CVI Network), focused on addressing gun \nviolence and enhancing safety within neighborhoods.

Notable requests included securing a canopy for community events and obtaining \nbilingual Spanish business cards to better serve the district\u2019s diverse population. As an incoming Supervisor with a newly \nformed staff, the District 1 Office is attending a high volume of trainings and conferences to ensure a thorough understanding \nof county procedures that strengthen its ability to effectively govern and increase its capacity for community service. \nGoals and Objectives: \n\u2022 \nCollaborate with the City of Vallejo to address district-specific needs and initiatives. \n\u2022 \nIdentify a district office space to hold community office hours, enhancing accessibility and engagement. \n\u2022 \nHost a series of community town halls to update residents on Solano County initiatives, operations, and budget. \n\u2022 \nApply the public health model to address office priorities: housing, public safety and economic opportunities. \n\u2022 \nDevelop and strengthen public-private partnerships to secure philanthropic support and foster community-driven solutions. \n\u2022 \nAdvocate for Social Equity and Inclusion. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents a decrease of $19,503 or 2.3% in appropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 \nAdopted Budget primarily due to decreases in Salaries and Employee Benefits due to new District 1 staff starting at lower salary \nsteps.

The ever-changing information given to State \nand local government will affect funding to counties throughout California. State and federal agency changes and inconsistent \ninformation dissemination from these agencies will challenge how the County can respond and meet the human services and \nfiscal needs for the next 3-plus years. \n\u2022 \nThe increased emergency wildfire response throughout the county has also been a significant undertaking and will require \nreallocation of resources to respond. \n\u2022 \nContinued challenges in managing air quality, environmental protections and environmental justice issues within District 2. \n\u2022 \nThe announcement of the Valero refinery closing will impact the city of Benicia and its constituents financially in the mid to \nlate term. Ongoing talks and opportunities will determine if another company purchases and reuses the facility, but it is still \ntoo early in the process to know the overall resolution. \n\u2022 \nExpanded enforcement and coordination of the weed abatement ordinance is always a challenge before and during the fire \nseason throughout District 2. \n\u2022 \nWater issues in Benicia, specifically the broken water main under Lopes Road as the land continues to slide in that area. The \nCounty is waiting on FEMA funds, which at this time have not materialized. \n\u2022 \nKing tide flooding in Benicia. Working with staff at SCWA to address flooding issues in low-lying areas within the District.

The District 4 \nSupervisor\u2019s budget provides for the expenditures of the elected supervisor and two full-time staff positions. As the elected \nrepresentative for District 4, Supervisor Vasquez is available to meet or speak with his constituents to assist them in resolving \nissues that arise. The District 4 office is maintained at the County Administration Center at 675 Texas Street in Fairfield. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nSupervisor Vasquez represents the citizens of Solano County on 27 County, regional and State boards and commissions as a \nmember or alternate member. These appointments include the Bay Conservation and Development Commission, Delta Counties \nCoalition, Delta Protection Commission, Solano County Water Agency (SCWA), Yolo-Solano Air Quality Management District, \nCounty Medical Services Program, and more. The preservation of agriculture and natural resources, along with issues affecting \nseniors and those in poverty remain significant priorities for Supervisor Vasquez. \nSince being sworn into office in 2003, Supervisor Vasquez has been selected by his peers to act as Chair eight times. He has \nbeen recognized nationally as a leader on the issue of childhood obesity and continues to work toward ensuring Solano County \nis the best place to Live, Work, Learn, Play and Age. \nAccomplishments: \n\u2022 \nSupervisor Vasquez supported the adoption of an Ag Mitigation Ordinance, which has been approved by the Board of \nSupervisors. This tool will help preserve Solano County\u2019s Ag lands for future generations of farmers and ranchers by \nestablishing clear regulations to mitigate the loss of farmland when new development occurs. \n\u2022 \nIn late 2024, the Board celebrated 44 Solano County centenarians ranging in age from 100 to 105 during the 18th Annual \nCentenarian Celebration, which has been strongly supported by Supervisor Vasquez. This event was held as a virtual \npresentation before the Board of Supervisors. The event provides the opportunity to recognize and honor our oldest living \nresidents for the wonderful things they have achieved and continue to experience in their lives. \n\u2022 \nSupervisor Vasquez supported, and the Board approved the purchase of the former Parkrose Gardens assisted living facility \nto be rededicated for Permanent Supportive Housing. This 52-unit facility will help the County\u2019s Health and Social Services, \nBehavioral Health Division, place county clients in a safe residential setting where they can access services. \n\u2022 \nSupervisor Vasquez has been supportive of the Prospera at Homestead affordable housing project in Dixon which broke \nground in Fiscal Year 24/25. Solano County allocated $3.2 million from its Housing Trust Fund for the 107-unit project that \nprovides needed workforce housing for those earning at or below 60 percent of the area median income. In addition, the \nproject has partnered with the Solano County Housing Authority (SCHA), which has pledged eight project-based vouchers to \nthe project. \n\u2022 \nSupervisor Vasquez continues to engage with the public through a monthly e-newsletter that highlights issues affecting District \n4 and the County as a whole. In addition, the use of social media such as X and Facebook have added more opportunity to \ninteract with constituents and promote exceptional people and events in Solano County. \n\u2022 \nSupervisor Vasquez worked with the Solano County Farm Bureau to sponsor multiple tire recycle events. This program is a \npartnership involving the Farm Bureau and the Conservation Corps North Bay, a certified and permitted waste tire hauler. \nSince September 2024, more than 1,000 unwanted or used tires have been recycled by Solano County\u2019s ag and rural \nresidents.",

Vasquez \nLegislative & Administration \n \n \n \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nF-15 \nGoals and commitments in the coming fiscal year: \n\u2022 \nClosely watch legislation that impacts water, our most important natural resource. Supervisor Vasquez is committed to being \nan advocate for all of Solano County at the local, State, and federal level on matters involving water and serves on SCWA, \nSolano Groundwater Sustainability Agency Board of Directors and is Vice Chair of the Delta Protection Commission. It is \ncritical to all residents that the County\u2019s current water sources are protected while working to create more storage for growing \ndemands. \n\u2022 \nSupervisor Vasquez continues to work toward the long-term sustainability of Solano County\u2019s rural fire protection districts. In \nMarch 2025, the Board of Supervisors assumed governance of the Vacaville, Suisun and Montezuma Fire Protection Districts. \nFor decades, there have been calls to reorganize rural fire districts in Solano County for greater efficiency, shared resources \nand standardized training. There is still a lot of work to be done before a reorganization may occur but the Board action on \ngovernance was a big step towards that goal. Any future proposals and discussions will come before the Solano County \nBoard of Supervisors in open meetings for consideration and public input. \n\u2022 \nWith agriculture being a large part of the District 4 working lands, Supervisor Vasquez will continue to be a proponent of \nSolano County\u2019s farmers, ranchers, and processors. In 2024, the County began work on the Sustainable Ag Lands \nConservation grant. The grant will be used to develop economic, infrastructure, and land use plans in support of the Board of \nSupervisors\u2019 agricultural preservation and economic development priorities. \n\u2022 \nWork with our County Agriculture Department to continue efforts to eradicate the Glassy-winged Sharpshooter, which was \ndiscovered in 2021 in Vacaville. Glassy-winged sharpshooters are invasive pests of concern to grape-growing regions. The \nAg department has already implemented high-density trapping measures and applied targeted treatments to protect the \nCounty\u2019s 4,000 acres of vineyards. \n\u2022 \nEconomic Development is a priority for Solano County. Supervisor Vasquez has prioritized a Utility Master Plan to address \ninfrastructure needs that will help attract new Ag businesses as well as provide the ability to create Ag worker housing. This \nwork is also done in conjunction with an Ag economic development plan. \nSupervisor Vasquez will continue to work to promote the hard work of County workers who, day in and day out, care for the health \nof our residents, ensure our roads are safe, protect our safety and property, serve our veterans, sustain our agricultural heritage, \neducate our children and so much more. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents an increase of $14,767 or 1.7% in appropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 \nAdopted Budget primarily due to increases in Salaries and Employee Benefits resulting from increases in retirement and health \nbenefit costs. Additionally, the Recommended Budget includes increases in Services and Supplies primarily due to increases in \ninsurance, central data processing charges, and computer related costs, offset by a decrease in Other Financing Uses due to the \nfull redemption of the Pension Obligation Bonds (POBs). \nDEPARTMENT COMMENTS \nNone. \n\n1004 \u2013 Fund 001-Board of Supervisors \u2013 District 4 \nDepartment Summary \nJohn M.

The District includes \none of the busiest installations in Air Mobility Command, some of the nation\u2019s richest farm and grazing land, a significant delta \necosystem, and the people who call this region home. \nIn his fifth year on the Board, Supervisor Mashburn has been chosen again for the second year by his peers as Chair of the Board \nof Supervisors. He also serves as Chair of the Solano Transportation Authority (STA), Chair of the Solano Subbasin Groundwater \nSustainability Agency; and on the City County Coordinating Council (4Cs) Joint Steering Committee. Additionally, Supervisor \nMashburn is the Primary representative for the Board on the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC), Delta Counties \nCoalition (DCC), the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo), the Yolo Solano Air Quality Management District, the Delta \nConservancy, the Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC), Northern California Counties Tribal Matters \nConsortium, Travis Community Consortium (TCC), Remote Access Network Board, Yolo Bypass/Cache Slough Partnership MOA, \nWinters Branch Library Financing Authority, and is the alternate representative on the Delta Protection Commission, Solano Water \nAuthority, Solano County Consolidated Oversight Board, and University of California Cooperative Extension Capitol Corridor Multi-\nCounty Partnership Leadership Advisory Committee. He also serves on numerous other committees and agencies directly related \nto these assignments. \nAs a member of the Board of Supervisors, Mashburn serves with his colleagues on the Solano County Water Agency (SCWA), \nSolano County City County Coordinating Council (4Cs), National Association of Counties (NACo), East Vallejo Fire Protection \nDistrict, Solano Facilities Corporation and In-Home Supportive Services Public Authority. \nThe Supervisor maintains an office at the County Government Center, located at 675 Texas Street, Suite 6500 in Fairfield, \nCalifornia. The District 5 Office budget provides for the expenditures of the elected Supervisor and two full-time staff members. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES \nChallenges: \nThere are five primary areas where new and ongoing challenges will impact all areas of budget and staffing. While certainly not a \ncomplete list, these are primary issue areas for Supervisor Mashburn that heavily impact the 5th District: \n\u2022 \nThe California State Budget remains precarious, with the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office identifying deficits through FY2028/29. \nCoupled with the end of American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funding, Supervisor Mashburn is committed to carefully monitor \nthe County\u2019s spending so we can continue to provide exceptional service to our communities. \n\u2022 \nFollowing the passage of Proposition 36 in November, law enforcement is once again able to gain control over criminal \nsyndicates, retail theft and drug trafficking. These problems have been plaguing parts of our county and state for years, and \nthe net benefit is already visible. \n\u2022 \nThe Delta Conveyance project which would shift more water from Northern California and the Bay Area south of the Delta \nhas been moving forward, against the strong objections of the Delta Counties Coalition. We continue to fight to protect the \nwater needs and balance of agricultural, urban and environmental uses. \n\u2022 \nThe availability of affordable housing continues to be a challenge to all communities in California, caused by numerous factors, \nmany of which are out of the control of local government.",

In addition to tracking progress, he will make it a point to regularly report out \nthat progress to the Board and to the community. \n\u2022 \nSupervisor Mashburn will continue his call for annual analysis of infrastructure assets, deficits and deferred maintenance, in \norder to invest regular maintenance dollars rather than be forced to replace expensive infrastructure and equipment. \n\u2022 \nProtecting Solano County\u2019s needs of water for urban use, agriculture, and the environment without allowing our communities \nto mitigate for the state remains one of his highest priorities. New threats like the Delta Conveyance must be met with more \naggressive lobbying and education efforts to continue our commitment to Delta security. \n\u2022 \nProtecting Travis Air Force Base, its missions, personnel, families, veterans, surrounding communities and its multi-billion-\ndollar economic impact from all threats is critical for Solano County\u2019s economy. Supervisor Mashburn believes it is a shared \nresponsibility to strengthen the programs and services we provide to veterans who call Solano County home. \n\u2022 \nEnsuring access to high-speed internet to rural households and businesses, and ensuring public safety has better functionality \nto communicate with one another is a priority with results in the works. A partnership between Comcast and Solano County \nusing ARPA funding is bringing high speed internet to Elmira this year, and other rural areas in the years ahead. \n\u2022 \nSolano County is a Right-to-Farm County. We will continue to promote and work for the ability of agriculture to succeed \nwithout threats caused by encroachment, loss of water and over-regulation. \n\u2022 \nOur ongoing efforts to improve communication between County Government and the people we serve steadily improves \nthrough our existing channels as we create new ones. Once again, we have increased participation in Supervisor Mashburn\u2019s \nFacebook page and email newsletter. We continue to consider supplementing that regular communication with advertising \nfor public meetings through direct mail as an appropriate and cost-effective vehicle. \n\u2022 \nAs in all years, we maintain Solano County\u2019s long-standing commitment to balanced budgets and strong reserves, while \nprotecting critical services and pushing back against state and federal unfunded mandates. \n\u2022 \nSupervisor Mashburn remains committed to ensuring our critical public safety needs are met at the neighborhood and \ncommunity level through a well-funded and responsive public safety structure that includes getting the men and women of \nlaw enforcement the tools they need. \n\u2022 \nThe County\u2019s multi-year effort toward simplifying the delivery of services to the homeless has made significant progress \nthrough the Community Action Partnership (CAP) Solano Joint Powers Authority. This maintains our regional approach with \nthe cities to minimize waste and overlap while maximizing funding. \nStaying Connected: \n\u2022 \nThrough a community newsletter that reaches more than 30,000 email inboxes, Supervisor Mashburn has called attention to \nprograms that benefit the people of Solano County. This delivery vehicle is what led to the groundbreaking for Elmira\u2019s new \nhigh-speed internet services, benefitting residents and small businesses alike. Using this method as a way to increase \ncommunications from constituents led to this recommendation from a resident, and ultimately funding through ARPA grants. \n\u2022 \nFinding strong and effective ways to stay connected as a community has continued to be a priority.

For unincorporated Solano County, the Sheriff\u2019s Office is the only law \nenforcement agency on patrol with needs that are unique from our city police departments. \n\u2022 \nSupervisor Mashburn\u2019s hands-on approach to code enforcement within the unincorporated areas in Solano County continues \nto ensure health and safety violations are addressed before becoming a larger problem. He and his staff have continued to \nengage in regular meetings with landowners and residents in areas of the 5th District that have seen significant problems with \nunsafe structures, fire prevention, illicit drugs, groundwater contamination, noise complaints, and numerous other issues that \ndemand attention. This effort continues to see significant success following a restructuring of code enforcement to better \nserve these needs. \n\u2022 \nIn keeping with his commitment to public safety, Supervisor Mashburn continues to meet with leadership, county staff and \nbargaining groups from Deputy Sheriffs, Corrections and Probation, to ensure their needs are met and that their voices are \nheard. \nAgriculture, Land Use, and Local Decisions: \n\u2022 \nAgriculture \u2013 from farming and ranching to aquaculture and viticulture \u2013 continues to drive more than $1.2 billion into Solano \nCounty\u2019s economy. Protecting it and the families who make it thrive is a significant reason why Supervisor Mashburn first had \nan interest in serving on the Board. As we tackle new and complex needs in both rural and urban planning, it is critical that \nwe make every decision here locally, with a consistent eye toward what\u2019s best to protect the largest drivers of our economy. \n\u2022 \nAlong with Supervisor Vasquez, with whom Supervisor Mashburn shares representation of most of Solano County\u2019s \nagricultural areas, they host meetings and mixers with the Solano County Farm Bureau and its Young Farmers and Ranchers \ngroup to bring more young people into farming and ranching. These events also serve to increase participation and an \nunderstanding by the ag community in how local government works. \n\u2022 \nSolano County is a \u201cRight to Farm\u201d county with a rich agricultural heritage. Growing more distinct crops than all but one other \nCalifornia county, Supervisor Mashburn continues to create a culture that supports agribusiness, based on the concept of \npartnering with farmers, ranchers, orchardists and greenhouse operators to \u201cHelp Us Help Them.\u201d County policies and \nprograms are continuously reviewed to protect the right to farm, while being nimble enough to adjust to market changes that \nallow agriculture to continue to flourish for generations to come. \nTransportation: \n\u2022 \nSupervisor Mashburn has long had an interest in planning for our transportation future, focusing on these issues when he \nwas a planning commissioner and then a member of the Vacaville City Council. After the retirement of Supervisor Jim Spering, \nMashburn took over primary representation to the Solano Transportation Authority. In January of 2025, former Supervisor \nSpering also stepped down after serving as Solano County\u2019s primary representative to the Metropolitan Transportation \nCommission for 35 years, longer than any other member of that body. Supervisor Mashburn has now taken on that additional \nrole in ensuring that Solano County receives its fair share of transportation considerations, planning and funding. \nProtecting the Mission and People of Travis Air Force Base: \n\u2022 \nSupervisor Mashburn continues to be a fierce advocate for the men, women and mission of Travis Air Force Base (AFB). His \nregular conversations and partnerships with command staff ensures that the county\u2019s position remains in alignment with Air \nForce needs and goals. He continues to be deeply engaged in the Travis Community Consortium, working with Congressional \npartners to communicate Solano County\u2019s unparalleled support of the base is well-communicated to the Pentagon. \n\u2022 \nThousands of veterans and their families live within the 5th District, many of whom stayed following their service at Travis \nAFB or at the former Mare Island Naval Shipyard because of access to base benefits and quality health care at the Veterans \nAffairs and David Grant Medical Center. Supervisor Mashburn takes meeting the needs of those who served very seriously \nand continues to highlight available services provided by the County of Solano and others and continues to showcase all \nsupportive services that are available to Veterans here in Solano.",

Each \nyear, he builds new momentum through new partnerships to better educate elected officials up and down the state about the \nimportance of storage and other alternatives rather than poorly planned water expressways. \n\u2022 \nDating back a century, there exists an ongoing battle to meet the water needs of agriculture, people and the environment, \noften pitting those in the water-rich North State against those living south of the Sacramento Bay Delta. From the peripheral \ncanal proposal of the 1980s to the twin tunnels of recent years, every scenario ends with Delta counties paying a greater \nprice for development in California\u2019s more arid climes. Supervisor Mashburn continues to protect the Solano Project, the \nTehama Aquifer, communities, natural environments, and the delta intakes that provide much of Solano County\u2019s water. \nBalanced Budget and Accountability: \n\u2022 \nWith his strong background in government budgeting, Supervisor Mashburn holds one-on-one meetings regularly with \ndepartment heads to better understand the changing needs of each department and the role they play in the shared \nresponsibility of serving the residents of Solano County. Rather than wait for budget hearings immediately before the deadline, \nSupervisor Mashburn has made it a point to help craft the budget from the beginning to ensure his goals for the County are \nin alignment with its spending habits. \n\u2022 \nThe American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funded more than $86.9 million in projects through competitive grants from the Solano \nCounty Board of Supervisors. Supervisor Mashburn worked diligently to ensure that the funding was spent prudently on \nprojects that will have a long-term impact: education, infrastructure, job training and technology. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents an increase of $8,044 or 1.0% in appropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted \nBudget primarily due to increases in Salaries and Employee Benefits resulting from increases in retirement and health benefit \ncosts, offset by a decrease in Other Financing Uses due to the full redemption of the Pension Obligation Bonds (POBs). \nDEPARTMENT COMMENTS \nNone. \nSOURCE OF FUNDS \n \nUSE OF FUNDS \n \n\n1005 \u2013 Fund 001-Board of Supervisors \u2013 District 5 \nDepartment Summary \nMitch Mashburn, Chair \n \nLegislative & Administration \n \n \n \nF-22 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \n \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS \nNone. \nSUMMARY OF POSITION CHANGES \nThere are no changes in position allocation. \nSTAFFING TREND \n \nPENDING ISSUES AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS \nThere are no pending issues or policy considerations at this time. \n \nDETAIL BY REVENUE\nCATEGORY AND\nAPPROPRIATION CATEGORY\n2023/24\n ACTUAL\n2024/25 \nADOPTED\nBUDGET\n2025/26\nRECOMMENDED\nFROM\nADOPTED TO\nRECOMMENDED\nPERCENT\nCHANGE\nAPPROPRIATIONS\nSALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\n532,011\n595,741\n607,187\n11,446\n1.9%\nSERVICES AND SUPPLIES\n54,668\n92,473\n93,148\n675\n0.7%\nOTHER CHARGES\n109,571\n142,110\n141,441\n(669)\n(0.5%)\nOTHER FINANCING USES\n3,395\n3,408\n0\n(3,408)\n(100.0%)\nINTRA-FUND TRANSFERS\n63\n200\n200\n0\n0.0%\nTOTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n699,708\n833,932\n841,976\n8,044\n1.0%\nNET COUNTY COST\n699,708\n833,932\n841,976\n8,044\n1.0%",

This budget also contains funding to the Courts as a County obligation under agreements for Maintenance of Efforts \n(MOE) with the State and other legally required funding of programs. Other expenditures budgeted in this budget unit cover costs \nnot readily allocated to departmental budgets. \n \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS \nThe Recommended Budget represents a net increase of $3,782,566 or 54.3% in revenues and an increase of $3,131,877 or 1.2% \nin appropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. The Net County Cost decreased by $650,689 or 0.3%. \nThe net increase in revenue of $3,782,566 is primarily due to a one-time transfer of $8,612,566 from the Pension Debt Service \nFund (BU 8006) due to the full redemption of the Pension Obligation Bonds (POBs). Any fund balance remaining in the Pension \nDebt Service Fund will be allocated to the Employer CalPERS Rate Increase Reserve in the General Fund. This increase is offset \nby a decrease of $5,000,000 in one-time transfers in from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) Coronavirus State and Local \nFiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF). All remaining funds designated by the Board to be used under the ARPA-SLFRF Revenue \nReplacement category were transferred in FY2024/25. \nThe net increase in appropriations of $3,131,877 is primarily the net result of an increase in Other Financing Uses, partially offset \nby decreases in Services and Supplies and Other Charges. The appropriations include the following: \nAccrued Leave Payoff allocation of $1,500,000, which is in line with the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. This appropriation is funded \nby the General Fund Reserve for Accrued Leave Payoff to cover payoffs to employees retiring or separating from County service \nand is used when a department\u2019s operating budget is unable to absorb the cost. \nPARS Supplementary Retirement Plan allocation of $503,000. This allocation was previously budgeted in the Pension Debt \nService Fund (BU 8006) and represents the County\u2019s costs for remaining employees who participated in the County\u2019s \nsupplemental retirement program offered in FY2010/11. This is a closed program. \nServices and Supplies include the following appropriations: \n\u2022 \n$679,440 for contracted and other professional services for management reviews, organizational

There are five \nCentral Services Departments: County Administrator, County Counsel, Human Resources, Auditor-Controller and General \nServices. The allocated costs and revenues are shown on the Countywide Cost Allocation Plan, calculated yearly by the Auditor-\nController\u2019s Office, and approved by the State Controller\u2019s Office. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents a decrease of $157,841 or 2.6% in both revenues and appropriations when compared to \nthe FY2024/25 Adopted Budget.

The offset can vary from year to year depending on \nthe level and cost of the services provided between General Fund departments when calculated and accounted for by the Auditor-\nController in the preparation of the annual mandated Countywide Administrative Overhead Plan calculation. For FY2025/26, \ndecreases were primarily due to lower actual costs in FY2023/24 and FY2024/25 compared to what was originally estimated and \ncollected through the Countywide Cost Allocation Plan.

The \nCOP was issued for the construction of the 6-story Government Center, 5-story parking structure, 2-story Probation Facility, and \nimprovement to the Central Utility Plant and the Library, all located in Fairfield. Departments using the Government Center and \nthe Probation Facility are allocated their corresponding share of the Debt Service due on the 2017 COP based on their building \nspace usage and a share of the parking structure. Any vacant office space in the Government Center is assigned to the General \nFund for purpose of allocating the costs of the 2017 COP debt service payments. This is the General Fund share for the 2017 \nCertificates of Participation (BU 8037). \nThe 2013 COPs were issued to finance the Animal Care Expansion Project at 2510 Clay Bank Road in Fairfield. The Animal Care \nExpansion Project includes the installation of a new pre-engineered kennel (12,500 square feet), and the renovation of the 2,600 \nsquare-foot portion of the existing 13,000 square-foot Animal Shelter building. In accordance with a Memorandum of \nUnderstanding, the County and the seven cities in the County agreed to share in the annual debt service requirements of the 2013 \nCOP. The County General Fund share is approximately 10% of the annual debt service requirements. This is the General Fund \nshare for the 2013 Certificates of Participation (BU 8036). \nThe 2021 COPs were issued to finance the cost to acquire, install, renovate, and construct certain capital improvements for various \nCounty Facilities including but not limited to, the installation of solar energy systems and other energy savings related projects. \nThis is the General Fund share for the 2021 Certificates of Participation (BU 8000). \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents an increase of $1,454,752 or 55.5% in appropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 \nAdopted Budget. This represents the General Fund share of the principal and interest payments on the 2021 COPs ($2,011,830), \n2017 COPs ($2,020,078), and the 2013 COPs ($44,970). \nSee related 2013 Certificates of Participation (BU 8036), 2017 Certificates of Participation (BU 8037), and 2021 Certificates of \nParticipation (BU 8000) under the Auditor-Controller. \n \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS \nThe General Fund\u2019s share of the 2021 COPs debt service payment was reduced in FY2024/25 due to interest income earned in \nthe 2021 COP Fund (BU 8000) in prior years, decreasing the need for General Fund support. The increase in FY2025/26 \nrepresents the General Fund\u2019s full share of the 2021 COPs debt service payments without any reduction resulting from interest \nincome earned in prior years. \nPENDING ISSUES AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS \nThere are no pending issues or policy considerations at this time. \n \nDETAIL BY REVENUE\nCATEGORY AND\nAPPROPRIATION CATEGORY\n2023/24\n ACTUAL\n2024/25 \nADOPTED\nBUDGET\n2025/26\nRECOMMENDED\nFROM\nADOPTED TO\nRECOMMENDED\nPERCENT\nCHANGE\nAPPROPRIATIONS\nOTHER FINANCING USES\n3,967,168\n2,622,126\n4,076,878\n1,454,752\n55.5%\nTOTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n3,967,168\n2,622,126\n4,076,878\n1,454,752\n55.5%\nNET COUNTY COST\n3,967,168\n2,622,126\n4,076,878\n1,454,752\n55.5%",

It examines all aspects of local government (the County and cities \nand special districts within the County) to ensure the best interests of the residents of Solano County are served. \nFUNCTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES \nThe Civil Grand Jury is an independent institution that monitors the legislative and administrative departments that make up \nCounty, City, and special district governments. Comprised of 19 citizens, the Civil Grand Jury examines the performance of local \ngovernment and makes recommendations on the appropriation of public funds and service delivery. The Civil Grand Jury is \nrequired by State law to investigate and report on the conditions of the seven \"public prisons\" in Solano County. It may also \ninvestigate citizen complaints and allegations of misconduct and examine fiscal and management practices within local \ngovernments. Grand Jury members are selected annually by the Superior Court of California. State law requires the Grand Jury \nto publish an annual report of its findings and recommendations. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nThe Solano County Grand Jury anticipates issuing six reports by June 2025. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents an increase of $25,455 or 14.3% in appropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 \nAdopted Budget. The increase in appropriations is primarily due to an increase in Countywide Administrative Overhead costs and \nIntrafund Transfers for building maintenance projects managed by the Department of General Services.

The United States Supreme Court \ndecisions Gideon v. Wainright and Argersinger v. Hamlin provide that no accused may be deprived of liberty as the result of any \ncriminal prosecution in which they were denied the assistance of counsel. \nFUNCTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES \nCalifornia Penal Code (PC) \u00a7987.2(a)(3) provides that in any case in which a person desires but is unable to employ counsel, and \nin which the Public Defender has properly refused to represent the accused, counsel is assigned by the Superior Court and shall \nreceive a reasonable sum for compensation and necessary expenses, paid out of the County General Fund. \nWhile the County Administrator is responsible for management of this budget, the Court has historically served as its ad hoc \nadministrator by appointing private attorneys subject to Court screening, and by providing initial processing of claims for services \nrendered consistent with a set of fees for services guidelines. \nPC \u00a7987.2 authorizes the court to establish a rate of reimbursement to private appointed counsel but requires the court to consult \nwith the Board of Supervisors and to ensure the sums are within the amount of funds allocated in the budget. The last analysis of \nrates was conducted in 2023 and new rates for both attorneys and private investigators began May 1, 2023.

(CMF) Cases \n \nBill Emlen, County Administrator \nJudicial \n \n \n \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nF-41 \nDEPARTMENTAL PURPOSE \nThis budget unit provides for the payment of County costs for adjudicating crimes committed on the grounds of the California \nMedical Facility and Solano State Prison in Vacaville. \nFUNCTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES \nThe California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation operates two institutions within Solano County, the California Medical \nFacility and Solano State Prison, which together house more than 5,000 inmates. The District Attorney prosecutes crimes \ncommitted on the grounds of the facilities, while the County is also responsible for ensuring the accused's defense. \nThe Superior Court, serving as lead agency in this matter, has entered into agreements with private attorneys to provide defense \nservices to inmates at the County\u2019s cost. The agreements also include the provision of investigative, psychological and \ntranscription services in connection with the assigned case when required. Pursuant to California PC \u00a74750, these costs are, in \nturn, eligible for almost full reimbursement by the State. Countywide Administrative Overhead costs, interest expense, and certain \ntreatment costs covered under PC \u00a72970 are not reimbursed by the State. \nWhile reimbursement rates to attorneys in prison matters are not necessarily tied to rates approved for other appointed attorneys, \nattorney rates for appointed counsel are interrelated and do impact county and local court budgets. PC \u00a7987.2 authorizes the \ncourt to establish a rate of reimbursement to private appointed counsel but requires the court to consult with the Board of \nSupervisors and to ensure the sums are within the amount of funds allocated in the budget. An analysis of rates was conducted, \nincluding a comparison of rates in neighboring counties as well as actual hourly rates for county attorneys. Based upon the \nproposed rate increase, the Court established a reimbursement rate for prison cases of $112/hour for attorneys and $65/hour for \nprivate investigators beginning May 1, 2023. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents a decrease of $45,142 or 5.3% in revenues and appropriations when compared to the \nFY2024/25 Adopted Budget. \nPrimary Funding Sources \nThe primary funding source for this budget unit is State reimbursement, which does not cover Countywide Administrative Overhead \ncosts, interest expense, and certain treatment costs. Due to the timing of State reimbursement, some revenues are accrued into \nthe next fiscal year. \nPrimary Costs \nThe increase in appropriations is primarily due to an increase in Legal Services related to an increase in appointed attorney rates. \nFixed Assets \nNone. \n \nDETAIL BY REVENUE\nCATEGORY AND\nAPPROPRIATION CATEGORY\n2023/24\n ACTUAL\n2024/25 \nADOPTED\nBUDGET\n2025/26\nRECOMMENDED\nFROM\nADOPTED TO\nRECOMMENDED\nPERCENT\nCHANGE\nREVENUES\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL REV STATE\n785,902\n857,235\n812,093\n(45,142)\n(5.3%)\nTOTAL REVENUES\n785,902\n857,235\n812,093\n(45,142)\n(5.3%)\nAPPROPRIATIONS\nSERVICES AND SUPPLIES\n774,675\n841,500\n789,000\n(52,500)\n(6.2%)\nOTHER CHARGES\n15,822\n15,735\n23,093\n7,358\n46.8%\nTOTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n790,497\n857,235\n812,093\n(45,142)\n(5.3%)\nCHANGE IN FUND BALANCE\n4,595\n0\n0\n0\n0.0%",

Plata. Collectively known as the 2011 Public Safety Realignment (Realignment), \nthe legislation, which included Assembly Bill (AB) 109, AB 117, AB 118, AB 116, ABX1 16 and ABX1 17, took effect on October \n1, 2011. Realignment is intended to reduce State prison overcrowding, save the State money, and reduce recidivism by expanding \nlocal responsibility for custody and control of specified offenders and their treatment and rehabilitation. \nThe legislation provided funding to counties and required the development of a local plan for the implementation of Realignment. \nThe Implementation Plan was to be developed by a body created under AB 109 and modified by AB 117 known as the Community \nCorrections Partnerships (CCP) Executive Committee. On November 1, 2011, the Board approved the County of Solano 2011 \nPublic Safety Realignment Act Implementation Plan. This plan is periodically required to be updated. The most recent update \noccurred in 2023. \nTo enable counties to plan for the implementation of Realignment, the State provided two separate \u201cbuckets\u201d of one-time funds. \nThe first was for planning and/or technical assistance for the County\u2019s CCP Executive Committee to develop the Local \nImplementation Plan, and the second was to cover County departments\u2019 implementation start-up costs. This budget was created \nto track the expenditure of these one-time funds. Additionally, this budget is used to track ongoing general administration \nexpenditures related to the actions of the County\u2019s CCP. \nThe 2011 Realignment-Administration budget represents a small component of the Solano County AB 109 budget, with the \nmajority of the County\u2019s AB 109 funding allocated within each of the respective County departments where AB 109 operations \noccur, including but not limited to the Probation Department, Sheriff, District Attorney, Public Defender, Alternate Defender, Health \n& Social Services, and Solano Courts. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents an increase of $2,965 or 1.1% in both revenues and appropriations when compared to the \nFY2024/25 Adopted Budget. The Recommended Budget includes $195,928 which will be provided to the Superior Court of \nCalifornia County of Solano for partial funding of the Court\u2019s Collaborative Court Manager and $24,135 for partial funding of the \nVeterans Court Case Manager.

Solano County received a one-time direct federal funding allocation under the \nCoronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) program of $86,949,405. The use of the direct funding allocation \nmust be in-line with eligible spending categories defined by the US Treasury\u2019s Final Rule per 31 CFR Part 35 and the 2023 Interim \nFinal Rule. Per the US Treasury the funding may be utilized to: \n\u2022 \nReplace lost public sector revenue, using this funding to provide government services up to the amount of revenue lost due \nto the pandemic. \n\u2022 \nRespond to the far-reaching public health and negative economic impacts of the pandemic, by supporting the health of \ncommunities, helping households, small businesses, impacted industries, nonprofits, and the public sector recover from \neconomic impacts. \n\u2022 \nProvide premium pay for essential workers, offering additional support to those who have and will bear the greatest health \nrisks because of their service in critical sectors. \n\u2022 \nInvest in water, sewer, and broadband infrastructure, making necessary investments to improve access to clean drinking \nwater, to support vital wastewater and stormwater infrastructure, and to expand affordable access to broadband internet. \n\u2022 \nProvide emergency relief from natural disasters or their negative economic impacts, including disasters that have occurred, \nare expected to occur imminently, or threatened to occur in the future. \n\u2022 \nAssist in funding eligible surface transportation projects. \n\u2022 \nFund eligible activities under the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG). \nEligible costs must be obligated during the period from March 3, 2021 through December 31, 2024 and fully expended by \nDecember 31, 2026. \nThe process for determining the allocation and use of the County\u2019s direct ARPA SLFRF funding has been at the discretion the \nCounty Board of Supervisors. The Board has directed a comprehensive process to review and identify County needs within the \neligible spending categories which included: \n\u2022 \nAnalysis of the U.S. Treasury\u2019s requirements. \n\u2022 \nReview of existing needs assessments and reports. \n\u2022 \nPublic outreach and community engagement including a community survey and two public hearings. \n\u2022 \nHearing presentations from subject matter workgroups on a wide variety of sectors, including children and education, \naffordable housing, homelessness, workforce development, small business assistance, infrastructure, food security, public \nhealth, behavioral health, and nonprofits. \nThe Board\u2019s process to determine the initial allocation of ARPA funding was initially completed in March 2023 and allocated funds \ntoward a total of 58 projects to support recovery and invest in the County\u2019s infrastructure for future growth. Since then, some \nprojects have been identified as not being able to be completed as initially designed and other projects have identified the need \nfor additional funds; initiating reallocations to meet the U.S. Treasury\u2019s obligation deadlines. In fall 2024, the Board finalized the \nreallocation of funds and the obligation deadline of December 31, 2024 was fully met with a final total of 63 projects. \nSolano County utilizes the American Rescue Plan Act Fund (Fund 290) to provide a separate budget unit to account for the \nCounty\u2019s utilization of the one-time federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund \n(SLFRF) allocation. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nMost ARPA projects are multi-year projects which carry funds across fiscal years.

On August 8, 2023, the Board approved the Housing \nTrust Fund Guidelines and adopted the Housing Trust Fund Ordinance which officially established the SCHTF and outlined its \npurpose and intent, with the Board of Supervisors serving as its governing body. Subsequently, a Notice of Funding Availability \n(NOFA) was issued to identify potential projects and programs to address the need for affordable housing in Solano County. \nOn November 7, 2023, the Board approved the allocation of an additional $1.7 million in ARPA funding to the SCHTF, bringing \nthe total available funding to $4.9 million. On January 9, 2024, $3 million of the original ARPA allocation and $200,000 of the $1.7 \nmillion allocation was allocated in FY2023/24 in support of a $3.2 million loan for the Dixon Hamstead project for 107 affordable \nhousing units. The Board also awarded $93,000 in a grant to Solano-Napa Habitat for Humanity. Both projects were approved on \nJanuary 9, 2024, resulting in an ARPA balance of $1,607,000. \nOn October 1, 2024, the Board allocated $1.407 million from the $1,607 million balance of the SCHTF to fund initial site preparation \nand engineering costs necessary to make a parcel owned by the County located at 580 North 1st Street in Dixon \u201cshovel ready\u201d \nfor the development of an affordable workforce housing project. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents a decrease of $1.5 million in revenues and no change in appropriations when compared \nto the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. The decrease in revenues reflects the reallocation of $1.5 million from the SCHTF to fund initial \nsite preparation and engineering costs for an affordable housing project in FY2024/25. \nPrimary Funding Sources \nThe primary funding source for this Fund was the initial ARPA allocation of $4.7 million and an annual allocation of $200,000 from \nthe Community Investment Fund (Fund 151 \u2013 BU 1570). As of June 30, 2025, it is anticipated that the Fund will have a balance of \n$400,000 to produce affordable housing. \nPrimary Costs \nAppropriations reflect the annual allocation of $200,000 from the Community Investment Fund (Fund 151 \u2013 BU 1570) for the \nSCHTF as required under Health & Safety Code \u00a750842.2.

This budget unit was \nestablished in the General Fund to provide funding to administer violence prevention activities on a countywide basis and enable \nstaff to receive and separately account for various federal, State, and private foundation grants, as mandated by funding agency \nguidelines. A portion of the appropriations in this budget unit are offset by dedicated revenue sources including Domestic Violence \nOversight/Vital Records Fees specifically to run and operate the Family Justice Center (FJC). This budget unit also serves as a \npass-through agency of Battered Women\u2019s Shelter Fees and Marriage License Fee Surcharge Funding collected pursuant to the \nCalifornia State Domestic Violence Centers Act. \nThe FJC is a coordinated and collaborative victim service delivery model that co-locates victim services professionals in a single \nlocation. The goal is to improve victim safety, reduce costs through shared resources, improve offender accountability through \nincreased successful prosecutions, and decrease children\u2019s exposure to violence by supporting victims\u2019 long-term safety through \neconomic empowerment. \nThe County entered into a contract with Contra Costa Family Justice Alliance (CCFJA) effective January 1, 2023, to act as the \nlead agency for the FJC in Solano County. CCFJA has partnered with the County and community agencies to provide services \nand programs to the residents of Solano County. These include assistance with filing protection orders, comprehensive needs \nassessments, referrals for public benefits, court accompaniment, Safe at Home applications, completion of California Victim \nCompensation Board (CalVCB) applications, and referrals to many other services. \nDomestic Violence Oversight \u2014 Vital Records Fees (DVO-VRF\u2019s) \nSolano County\u2019s Vital Records Fees (Health and Safety Code \u00a7103628 and Welfare and Institutions Code \u00a718309.5) authorized \npursuant to State legislation first enacted in 2005 AB 2010 allowed for collection of an extra $2 on certain vital records requests in \norder to fund governmental coordination and oversight of domestic violence related services. Subsequent legislation Senate Bill \n(SB) 154 (Wolk) enacted in 2011 eliminated the sunset date for this legislation, ensuring Solano County a continued revenue \nsource dedicated to oversight of domestic violence related services. DVO-VRF funding was instrumental in the planning, \ndevelopment, and launch of the FJC and continues to support its operational costs. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nChallenges: \n\u2022 \nDespite continued growth and expanded services, challenges remain in reaching and effectively supporting underserved \npopulations. Many individuals from marginalized communities are still unaware of the services available through the FJC. \n\u2022 \nBuilding trust with immigrant clients has become a significant challenge, many are fearful of engaging with law enforcement \nand county agencies due to concerns related to their immigration status or past experiences. Addressing this requires ongoing \nrelationship-building, culturally responsive services, and intentional efforts to create a safe, welcoming environment where all \nclients feel respected and supported. \nAccomplishments: \n\u2022 \nCCFJA, the lead agency for the FJC, partners with more than 15 County and Community agencies providing safety planning, \nlegal support, access to counseling and medical care, access to housing and benefits, employment training, long-term \nplanning, children\u2019s and youth services, along with a supervised visitation and exchange program. Ongoing collaboration with \nthese partners has enabled the acquisition of new federal and state grants, expanding the range of services available to \naddress unmet needs in the community. Including free legal consultations and representation for restraining orders and family \nlaw matters, as well as no-cost mental health services for adults and children impacted by violence. Telehealth services have \nalso been implemented to support clients with a variety of medical needs. \n\u2022 \nThe newest initiative, Solano SKY (Supporting Kids and Youth), addresses the effects of abuse and exposure to violence \namong children and adolescents. The program provides individual and group therapy, family counseling, and support services \nto youth ages 5 to 18 who have experienced trauma.

In addition, the Center recorded \nover 1,260 in-person visits, responded to 1,053 advice calls, and saw more than 775 new navigation clients. The majority of \nclients served were victims of domestic violence (82%); Other clients served were victims of elder abuse (6%), stalking (6%), \nchild abuse (7%), sexual assault (7%), and human trafficking (1%). Please note that while this amount is more than 100%, \nsome clients are seen for more than one type of service. \n\u2022 The Safe 4 Us Supervised Visitation Program, launched in July 2023, supported 36 children between the ages of 0 and 14 in \n2024, with ages 2 and 9 being the most represented. Of these children, 21% resided in Fairfield, 21% in Vacaville, and 11% \nin Vallejo.

In August 2023 the Board accepted the Strategic \nPlanning Report and dissolved the SFJC Advisory Committee. The CAO\u2019s Office, in coordination with CCFJA, established a \npermanent Steering Committee to provide ongoing guidance and leadership to the workgroups recommended in the Strategic \nPlanning Report, provide oversight to the SFJC operations, act as an accountability partner for the new lead agency, CCFJA, and \ncoordinate with the CCFJA Board of Directors and the Solano County Board of Supervisors. This Steering Committee is considered \nbest practice within Family Justice Centers across the country. The Steering Committee meets four times a year to discuss the \nstatus of the FJC and get updates from CCFJA, it March the Steering Committee participated in the first annual fundraiser for the \nFJC which raised an estimated $25,000 and has recommended that the CCFJA lead agency contract be renewed for a five-year \nterm. \nDETAIL BY REVENUE\nCATEGORY AND\nAPPROPRIATION CATEGORY\n2023/24\n ACTUAL\n2024/25 \nADOPTED\nBUDGET\n2025/26\nRECOMMENDED\nFROM\nADOPTED TO\nRECOMMENDED\nPERCENT\nCHANGE\nREVENUES\nLICENSES, PERMITS & FRANCHISE\n41,217\n45,000\n45,000\n0\n0.0%\nFINES, FORFEITURES, & PENALTY\n742\n1,500\n500\n(1,000)\n(66.7%)\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL REV STATE\n444,431\n123,872\n0\n(123,872)\n(100.0%)\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL REV FEDERAL\n39,163\n0\n0\n0\n0.0%\nMISC REVENUE\n180,955\n300,000\n100,000\n(200,000)\n(66.7%)\nTOTAL REVENUES\n706,508\n470,372\n145,500\n(324,872)\n(69.1%)\nAPPROPRIATIONS\nSALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\n578,639\n260,107\n3,765\n(256,342)\n(98.6%)\nSERVICES AND SUPPLIES\n870,898\n819,990\n802,884\n(17,106)\n(2.1%)\nOTHER CHARGES\n327,593\n299,991\n127,481\n(172,510)\n(57.5%)\nOTHER FINANCING USES\n5,839\n2,605\n0\n(2,605)\n(100.0%)\nINTRA-FUND TRANSFERS\n147,798\n141,616\n165,197\n23,581\n16.7%\nTOTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n1,930,767\n1,524,309\n1,099,327\n(424,982)\n(27.9%)\nNET COUNTY COST\n1,224,259\n1,053,937\n953,827\n(100,110)\n(9.5%)\nSTAFFING\nOFFICE OF FAMILY VIOLENCE MGMT\n3\n3\n0\n(3)\n (100.0%)\nTOTAL STAFFING\n3\n3\n0\n(3)\n (100.0%)",

All functions of the Recorder are conducted under \nand adhere to the provisions of the State Constitution, State \nand County Codes. In Solano County, the elected office of \nthe County Recorder is combined with the County Assessor \nas a single countywide elected office. \n \nBudget Summary: \nFY2024/25 Midyear Projection: \n2,505,035 \nFY2025/26 Recommended: \n3,014,828 \nCounty General Fund Contribution: \n1,292,328 \nPercent County General Fund Supported: \n42.9% \nTotal Employees (FTEs): \n14 \nFUNCTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES \nUnder the Recorder's Office, four units work together to securely handle a variety of documents on behalf of the public and State. \n\u2022 \nThe Examining Unit receives, examines, and records land title documents, military records, maps, and construction contracts. \nIt also provides certified copies of documents and assists the public. \n\u2022 \nThe Indexing/Verifying Unit indexes all land title and vital records to create a searchable database, so all records are easily \nretrievable. To ensure accuracy of the recorded documents index, every document is quality-control checked by the unit's \nstaff. \n\u2022 \nThe Scanning Unit images all records, filed and registered, that are accepted by the Recorder's Office. To ensure accuracy \nand reproducibility, every document is quality-control checked by the unit's staff. In addition, microfilm copies of records are \nproduced for archival storage in compliance with law. \n\u2022 \nThe Vital Records Unit, by statute, provides search, retrieval, and certified record services where the public can obtain legal \ncopies of birth, death, and marriage documents. \nIn accordance with the California Revenue and Taxation Code, a tax is imposed on each recorded document in which real property \nis sold; a tax on deeds transferring, granting, assigning, or otherwise conveying title of property within the County. The Recorder's \nOffice collects and distributes these Documentary Transfer Taxes on behalf of the County and cities. \nThe Recorder's Office also acts as the central collector of additional mandated fees associated with the recording of documents \nand distributes that revenue to the benefiting agencies. Daily, the Recorder collects and disburses special fees and surcharges \nover and above actual recording fees for these agencies. Presently, the Recorder's Office collects funds for trial court funding, \nfamily violence prevention, local spousal and child abuse programs, the Assessor, the District Attorney, Resource Management's \nPublic Works Division, State Department of Health, State Controller, and all cities in Solano County. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nAccomplishments: \n\u2022 \nThe Recorder's Office indirectly supports health and public safety programs by collecting revenues on their behalf. In 2024, \nthe Recorder's Office collected $13,500 for the State of California's Family Law Trust Fund, $34,800 for the County's Office \nof Family Violence Prevention, and $70,100 for the County's Children's Trust, which funds child neglect and abuse prevention",

Collections also included: $212,500 for the Trial Court Fund to help State court operating costs, \n$323,000 for the District Attorney's real estate fraud prosecution fund, and $2.3 million to the State Controller for the Building \nHomes and Jobs Act. The Recorder\u2019s Office collected Property Transfer Tax fees on behalf of the County and its cities in the \namount of $7.6 million. \n\u2022 \nOn September 25, 2024, Assembly Bill (AB) 1785 was enacted, amending Government Code \u00a77928.205 relating to Public \nRecords. This prohibited a state or local agency from publicly posting, as defined, the home address, telephone number, or \nboth the name and assessor parcel number associated with the home address of any elected or appointed official on the \ninternet without first obtaining the written permission of that individual. The office restricted references to assessor parcel \nnumbers on all online record indexes in accordance with the law as of January 2025. \n\u2022 \nIn late 2024, the Assessor/Recorder was notified that the current Records Management System (RMS), was not compliant \nwith Microsoft server maintenance and required replacement. In preparation of contracting a new vendor for RMS services, \nthe Recorder\u2019s Office is documenting business processes, reviewing current data for data clean up, and indexing and verifying \nhistorical documents to ensure they are available and searchable in the new system. \n\u2022 \nTo provide a complete searchable index of County records, approximately 56,000 historical handwritten documents have \nbeen imaged and manually indexed by Recorder staff. This effort is to not only prepare documents for review required by AB \n1466: Record Covenant Modification Program, but also to refine official records in preparation of a possible new RMS. \nWORKLOAD INDICATORS \n\u2022 \nIn 2024, the office examined, recorded, indexed, and verified over 65,000 documents: 39,300 E-Recorded, 20,500 submitted \nby mail or in person, of which 5,500 were multi-document titles which is a single document that contains more than one \ntransaction, where each transaction requires separate entries in a database or index. \n\u2022 \nIn 2024, approximately 17,400 official birth, death, and marriage certificates were issued as well as over 4,500 certified copies \nof official records. \n\u2022 \nThe Recorder (under the direction of the State Registrar) registers and keeps record of all Solano County public marriages. \nIn 2024, over 1,400 public marriages were registered. \n\u2022 \nThe Recorder\u2019s Office continues to aid the District Attorney in the collection of fees for the Real Estate Fraud Prosecution \nFund. The fee was applied to 31,700 of over 60,000 official documents recorded. In collaboration with the District Attorney\u2019s \nOffice, a visual monitoring system has been connected in the Recorder\u2019s lobby. \n\u2022 \nIn 2024, a total of 1,400 social security numbers were redacted from current official documents. In 2007, the Governor signed \ninto law AB 1168 which requires county recorders to establish a social security number truncation program. Under the current \nprogram any social security number contained in the public record may be truncated by redacting the first five digits of the \nnumber. \n\u2022 \nIn September 2017, the Governor signed into law Senate Bill (SB) 2 Building Homes and Jobs Act, which requires the county \nrecorder to collect a fee on real estate instruments, paper or notices on behalf of the State of California. These funds are \ndedicated to the development of affordable housing throughout the State. In 2024, the Recorder collected the SB 2 fee on \n31,700 qualifying official records. \n\u2022 \nIn 2024, 39,300 documents were recorded electronically, which accounts for 66% of recorded documents. In 2006, the Board \nadopted Resolution No. 2006-220 which approved the County participation in the Electronic Recording Delivery Act of 2004 \n(ERDA) and authorized the Recorder\u2019s Office to execute a Memorandum of Understanding with the State Department of \nJustice (DOJ) in accordance with the ERDA, and approved the issuance of payments to the DOJ for the County\u2019s allocated \nshare of the direct cost of program oversight. On November 17, 2020, the office also received Board approval to participate \nin the Statewide Electronic Courier Universal Recording Environment (SECURE), a multi-county Electronic Recording \nDelivery System (ERDS) owned and operated by Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, and San Diego counties. The system is \ncompliant with Government Code \u00a727392(a) which requires the recording delivery system to be operational only with system \ncertification by the Attorney General. The change to the new system occurred on July 1, 2021.",

This bill includes a requirement of each county recorder to establish \na restrictive covenant program to assist in the redaction of unlawfully restrictive covenants. On July 1, 2022, the Recorder\u2019s Office \nimplemented a plan, as specified, to identify unlawfully restrictive covenants in the office\u2019s records, and to redact unlawfully \nrestrictive covenants. The Recorder\u2019s Office is currently exploring solutions to automate the process of identifying digitized official \nrecords that may require redaction. \nIn late 2024, the Assessor/Recorder was notified that its current RMS required replacement. In preparation of a new RMS, the \nRecorder\u2019s Office is documenting business processes, reviewing current data for data clean up, and Indexing and Verifying \nHistorical Records to ensure they are searchable in the new system. To achieve these goals, the Assessor/Recorder plans to \nutilize modernization funds collected in Recorder Special Revenue (Fund 215) to enact projects designed to meet State of \nCalifornia legislative program goals, comply with Solano County Technology Standards, and document recording processes and \nrequirements for future RMS enhancements. Funds will be used for both staff time as reimbursements to operating costs and \ncontracting expenses directly from the special revenue fund. \nThe Recorder\u2019s Office has reviewed over 14.5 million recorded documents to determine if they are in a digital format, correctly \nindexed and verified, and easily accessed by the public. Of those, 200,000 documents required additional work to be fully \nintegrated into the current records management system. Working from original texts, microfilm, and recently digitized files, \ndocuments are actively being worked and data is being refined in anticipation of future projects.",

GC \u00a727361(c). \n\u2022 \nBU 4003: The SSN Truncation Program fund is used for the creation and maintenance of the Recorder's SSN Truncation \nProgram. This program protects Solano County citizens and the public from identity theft. Funds from this program are strictly \ndedicated to create and maintain a dual records system, containing two separate yet similar data bases, one for \u201cOfficial \nRecords\u201d which contain Social Security Numbers but are exempt from the Public Records Act (except pursuant to a subpoena \nor Court Order), and the other for \u201cPublic Records\u201d that are an exact copy of the \u201cOfficial Records\u201d except for a truncated \nSocial Security Number. GC \u00a727361(d). Pursuant to GC \u00a727361(d)(2), the Recorder\u2019s Office ceased collection of this fee \neffective January 1, 2018. It is anticipated that existing Fund Balance can sustain the program until the year 2038. \n\u2022 \nBU 4005: The Electronic Recording fund was implemented in FY2018/19 by the Recorder to collect the $1.00 fee per recorded \ndocument to support and administer an Electronic Recording Delivery System (ERDS). GC \u00a727391 et seq. enacted the \nElectronic Recording Delivery Act of 2004 (Act), authorizing a county recorder, upon approval by resolution of the Board and \nsystem certification by the Department of Justice, to establish an electronic recording delivery system for use by title \ncompanies, lending institutions and certified submitters who wish to avail themselves of the electronic recording service. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents an increase of $125,000 or 15.0% in revenues and an increase of $854,700 or 85.2% in \nappropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget.

These revenues \nare the source of funding to support the County\u2019s general-purpose appropriations including mandated Maintenance of Effort \ncontributions, mandated minimum levels of program service, general government programs and services, as well as other Board \npriorities. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents a net increase of $14,723,993 or 5.6% in revenues and no change in appropriations when \ncompared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. As a result, the net increase to the General Fund is $14,723,993 or 5.6%. \nPrimary Funding Sources \nGeneral Revenues include property tax, property transfer tax, sales tax, property tax in-lieu of vehicle license fees, interest \nearnings, redevelopment dissolution revenues including pass-through and residual taxes, business license tax, and disposal fees. \nThe significant changes in projected revenues over FY2024/25 Adopted Budget are primarily due to the following: \n\u2022 \n$5,420,818 increase in Current Secured Property Taxes due to an estimated increase of 3% in assessed values from the \nFY2024/25 corrected assessment roll. \n\u2022 \n$3,536,255 increase in Property Tax In-Lieu based on an estimated increase of 3% in assessed values. \n\u2022 \n$2,000,000 increase in Supplemental Secured due to the collection of past year supplemental tax bills. Due to the County\u2019s \ntransition to a new property tax system, County Assessment and Taxation System (CATS), supplemental bills were \ntemporarily delayed, resulting in the projected increase. \n\u2022 \n$1,400,000 increase in Current Unsecured Property Taxes based on anticipated increases in business property values. \n\u2022 \n$535,302 increase in ABX1 26 Residual Taxes and a $880,318 increase in ABX1 26 Pass-Through revenues based on \nprojected tax increment revenues. \n\u2022 \n$500,000 increase in excess tax loss reserve due to a projected increase in penalties and interest collections. \n\u2022 \n$320,000 increase in State Motor Vehicle In-Lieu Tax due to higher prior year collections of Motor Vehicle License Fees. \n\u2022 \n$319,000 increase in Unitary Taxes due to a projected increase of 3% in assessed values. \n\u2022 \n$50,000 increase in Penalties due to an increase in late Current Unsecured Property Tax payments. \n\u2022 \n$160,000 decrease in Prior Secured and Unsecured as this revenue is now being collected under Current Unsecured Property \nTaxes. \n\u2022 \n$51,000 decrease in Sales & Use Tax due based on estimated statewide decline in retail sales. \n\u2022 \n$27,000 decrease in Homeowners Property Tax Relief due to fewer homeowner exemptions. \nPrimary Costs \nAppropriations of $600,000 include: $500,000 in prior year property tax refunds, $50,000 for professional services for sales tax \nfinancial services, and $50,000 for general accounting and auditing services for the Solano County Fair in accordance with the \nMemorandum of Understanding. \nContracts \nNone. \nFixed Assets \nNone. \n\n1101 \u2013 Fund 101-General Revenue \nSummary of Other Administered Budgets \nJanine Harris, Auditor-Controller \nLegislative & Administration \n \n \n \nF-72 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \n \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS \nNone. \nPENDING ISSUES AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS \nThere are no pending issues or policy considerations at this time. \n \nDETAIL BY REVENUE\nCATEGORY AND\nAPPROPRIATION CATEGORY\n2023/24\n ACTUAL\n2024/25 \nADOPTED\nBUDGET\n2025/26\nRECOMMENDED\nFROM\nADOPTED TO\nRECOMMENDED\nPERCENT\nCHANGE\nREVENUES\nTAXES\n235,472,526\n242,580,307\n256,511,000\n13,930,693\n5.7%\nLICENSES, PERMITS & FRANCHISE\n1,302,819\n901,000\n901,000\n0\n0.0%\nREVENUE FROM USE OF MONEY/PROP\n12,615,686\n6,000,500\n6,000,500\n0\n0.0%\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL REV STATE\n3,065,653\n2,107,501\n2,400,501\n293,000\n13.9%\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL REV FEDERAL\n52,805\n6,400\n6,700\n300\n4.7%\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL REV OTHER\n174,604\n45,000\n45,000\n0\n0.0%\nCHARGES FOR SERVICES\n8,670,933\n8,500,000\n8,500,000\n0\n0.0%\nMISC REVENUE\n2,884,424\n3,050,000\n3,550,000\n500,000\n16.4%\nTOTAL REVENUES\n264,239,451\n263,190,708\n277,914,701\n14,723,993\n5.6%\nAPPROPRIATIONS\nSERVICES AND SUPPLIES\n7,124\n50,000\n50,000\n0\n0.0%\nOTHER CHARGES\n304,050\n550,000\n550,000\n0\n0.0%\nTOTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n311,174\n600,000\n600,000\n0\n0.0%\nNET COUNTY COST\n(263,928,277)\n(262,590,708)\n(277,314,701)\n(14,723,993)\n5.6%",

In prior years, the Disaster Fund was utilized for tracking costs for the 2014 Napa Earthquake, the 2017 \nWinter Storm Flooding, the 2017 October Wildfires, the 2019 Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) and wildfires, the 2020 LNU \nLightning Complex fire, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The following are the recent and/or active disaster events which are being \naccounted for in the Disaster Fund. \nCOVID-19 \nOn February 26, 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control confirmed the first person-to-person transmission of the Novel \nCoronavirus COVID-19 had affected a Solano County resident. On February 27, 2020, the County Administrator proclaimed a \nlocal emergency pursuant to Government Code \u00a78630 which was ratified by the Board on March 3, 2020. Governor Newsom \nissued an emergency proclamation proclaiming a state of emergency in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic on March 4, 2020, \nand on March 22, 2020, the President approved the request for a Major Disaster Declaration, allowing for the provision of federal \naid to assist with recovery efforts. \nIn FY2020/21, the County received $45 million in CARES Act funding to stop the spread and mitigate the impacts of the COVID-\n19 pandemic. All CARES Act funds were fully expended by the December 30, 2020, State deadline. In addition to one-time COVID-\n19 response funding, such as the CARES Act, the County pursued reimbursement for eligible COVID-19 costs through the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency (FEMA) COVID-19 Disaster declaration claim process. The pandemic response continued into \nFY2022/23; however, no future expenditures or recoupment of federal aid is anticipated. \nAs part of the Federal Relief and Supplemental Appropriations Act passed on December 27, 2020, the County received \n$13,309,204 in FY2020/21 to implement the Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP). In partnership with contractors and \nclose communication with the State, the County\u2019s program has assisted over 1,100 low-income households with rental and utility \narrearages. The allocation is fully expended, and the program concluded in FY2022/23. No administrative costs are anticipated in \nFY2024/25. \nAmerican Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) - On March 11, 2021, the President signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law. \nThe $1.9 trillion package is intended to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, including the public health and economic impacts. The \nARPA allocates funding for public health and vaccines, assistance for vulnerable populations, educational and housing \nstabilization, economic recovery assistance and direct assistance for families and individuals. The County received a direct \nallocation through the federal ARPA Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund (SLFRF) of $86.9 million. For additional \ndetails on the direct ARPA funding see Fund 290 \u2013 BU 2960 American Rescue Plan Act Fund. \nLNU Lightning Complex Fire \nThe LNU Lightning Complex fire consisted of a series of wildfires that burned during the 2020 California wildfire season across \nLake, Napa, Sonoma, Mendocino, Yolo, and Solano counties from August 17 to October 2, 2020, for a total burn area of 363,220 \nacres. At the time of containment, the LNU Lighting Complex fire was the fourth-largest wildfire in the recorded history of California. \nFor Solano County, the LNU Lightning Complex fire resulted in the loss of life and serious injuries and destroyed a total of 711 \nstructures on 501 parcels. Of the 302 homes destroyed, 261 were primary residences and 41 were accessory dwelling units. The \nremaining 409 accessory structures destroyed included barns, detached garages, storage buildings, and sheds. \nThe County continues recovery efforts in the wake of one of the largest wildfires in California history. Staff in coordination with the \nBoard continue to work with residents impacted by the fire to safely rebuild. In addition, the fire damaged several County facilities, \nwhich staff are also working to repair. As the County works through the recovery process, staff primarily in the Resource \nManagement Department in coordination with the Auditor-Controller, Sheriff\u2019s Office of Emergency Services, and the County \nAdministrator\u2019s Office will continue to monitor and recover all eligible expenditures through the FEMA disaster declaration claim \nprocess. The FY2025/26 Recommended Budget reflects anticipated revenues and appropriations related to LNU fire recovery. As \nrecovery efforts are ongoing, future adjustments may be necessary.",

The roads in the unincorporated area were impacted by slips, wash outs, mudslides \nand storm debris, requiring the need for repair and clean-up. In March 2023, a separate series of storm events caused additional \nslip failures, mudslides, storm debris, and fallen trees. All costs related to damage caused by these storm events were funded out \nof the Road Fund (Fund 101) and the Resource Management Department is pursuing reimbursements from the State and/or \nfederal agencies as applicable. If reimbursements fail to materialize, this could impact appropriations in the Disaster Fund. Staff \nwill monitor reimbursement activity and any future adjustments to the Disaster Fund, if applicable, will be brought forward to the \nBoard. \nDecember 2024 Storm Events \nSolano County experienced King Tides from December 13-15, 2024 resulting in higher than average water levels, combined with \na significant wind and precipitation event from December 13-16, 2024. On December 21, 2024, the Assistant County Administrator, \nacting as the Director of Emergency Services, proclaimed a local emergency in response to conditions caused by the December \n2024 Winter Storms. The Board ratified the Proclamation of Local Emergency at a special meeting on December 27, 2024. \nThe storm produced 2.27 inches of rain and peak wind gusts of 54 miles per hour, causing extensive damage to levee infrastructure \nwithin the Suisun Marsh and Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta region of the county. The damages included levee slips, \nseepage, erosion, wave wash, cracks and breaches. Although the Reclamation Districts are responsible for managing and \ncoordinating emergency responses and recovery efforts within their jurisdiction, the damage exceeded their resources. As a result, \nthe County incurred costs and were funded out of the Sheriff\u2019 Office of Emergency Services (OES) operating budget. OES staff is \npursuing reimbursements from the State and/or federal agencies as applicable. If reimbursements fail to materialize, this could \nimpact the appropriations in the Disaster Fund. Staff will monitor reimbursement activity and any future adjustments to the Disaster \nFund, if applicable, will be brought forward to the Board. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents a decrease of $1,025,000 or 80.4% in revenues and a decrease of $947,670 or 79.1% in \nappropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget.

Soil saturation continues to be a concern, and levee \nsystem faces ongoing risk. Reclamation Districts have continued temporary mitigation measures, such as placing plastic sheeting \nand sandbags over the levee crown to prevent further erosion. Damages may include, but are not limited to, levee slips, seepage, \nerosion, wave wash, cracks, and breach(es). The full extent of damages cannot be evaluated until after the winter season ends, \nand crews can better assess damages and implement repairs. Although the rainy season has presumably ended, recovery efforts \ncontinue to be ongoing for the impacted Reclamation Districts. Once damage is assessed, staff will return to the Board with any \nknown costs, if applicable. \nThe risk of additional fire-related emergencies in Solano County remains high. Due to the likelihood of fire danger, it is expected \nthat there will be Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) events in FY2025/26 despite PG&E\u2019s efforts to refine PSPS boundaries and \nminimize the impacts on its customers. The County continues to focus on resiliency and preparedness for fire-related emergencies. \nCounty staff remain ready to respond through the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) should an emergency occur.",

Due to the dissolution of redevelopment agencies under ABX1 26, effective February \n1, 2012, this note was transferred to the Suisun City Successor Agency. \nCertificates of Participation \nThe County issued Certificates of Participation (COP) for the acquisition and construction of major capital facilities. The proceeds \nof the COP were used for the construction of the County Administration Center in downtown Fairfield, the Probation Facility, the \nimprovements to the Central Utility Plant, the Library in Fairfield, and the Animal Shelter. The 2021 Certificates of Participation \nwere issued October 1, 2021 to finance the cost to acquire, install, renovate, and construct certain capital improvements for various \nCounty Facilities including, but not limited to, the installation of solar energy systems and other energy savings related projects \nsuch as: Beck Campus, Vallejo Campus, William J. Carroll Government Center, Downtown Campus, Fairfield Library Campus, \nand Juvenile Detention Facility. \nTaxable Pension Obligation Bonds \nOn November 1, 2005, the County issued $42.3 million of Taxable Pension Obligation Bonds (POB Series 2005) to prepay an \nobligation under its contract with CalPERS for the County\u2019s Unfunded Accrued Actuarial Liability (UAAL), thus reducing its UAAL. \nThe County\u2019s POB Series 2005 was paid in full in January 2025 and therefore, has no outstanding long-term debt. \nCredit Rating \nMoody\u2019s and Standard & Poor\u2019s both rated the County\u2019s pension obligation bonds as Aa2 and AAA, respectively. In addition, the \nCounty currently has three certificates of participation series outstanding. The credit ratings are as follows: \n2013 COP is private placement with no rating. \n2017 COP AA+ Stable from S&P. \n2021 COP AA+ Stable from S&P. \nThe affirmation of the ratings on the County\u2019s certificates of participation and pension obligation bonds reflect the County\u2019s \ngrowing tax base, solid financial and liquidity position, recovering but sound long-term economic fundamentals, and \nsocioeconomic profile compared to similarly rated counties nationally. \n \n \n\nDebt Service Overview \nJanine Harris, Auditor-Controller \nDebt \n \n \n \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nF-77 \nCOUNTY OF SOLANO, CALIFORNIA \nLegal Debt Margin Information \nLast Ten Fiscal Years \nFiscal \nYear \n(1) \nAssessed Value of \nProperty \n(2) \nDebt Limit, 5% \nof Assessed \nValue \n(3) \nDebt \nApplicable to \nthe Limit \n(4) \nLegal Debt \nMargin \nTotal net \ndebt \napplicable to \nthe limit as a \npercentage \nof debt limit \n \n2023-24 \n \n$73,517,076,522 \n \n$3,675,853,826 \n \n$4,870,000 \n \n$3,670,983,826 \n \n0.13% \n \n2022-23 \n \n69,904,769,268 \n \n3,495,238,463 \n \n9,310,000 \n \n3,485,928,463 \n \n0.27% \n \n2021-22 \n \n66,807,006,308 \n \n3,340,350,315 \n \n13,360,000 \n \n3,326,990,315 \n \n0.40% \n \n2020-21 \n \n62,304,767,500 \n \n3,115,238,375 \n \n17,040,000 \n \n3,098,198,375 \n \n0.55% \n2019-20 \n60,493,772,968 \n3,024,688,648 \n20,375,000 \n3,004,313,648 \n0.67% \n2018-19 \n57,621,468,703 \n2,881,073,435 \n23,375,000 \n2,857,698,435 \n0.81% \n2017-18 \n54,604,488,570 \n2,730,224,429 \n26,085,000 \n2,704,139,429 \n0.96% \n2016-17 \n51,753,424,096 \n2,587,671,205 \n32,880,000 \n2,554,791,205 \n1.27% \n2015-16 \n \n48,822,843,080 \n \n2,441,142,154 \n \n40,810,000 \n \n2,400,332,154 \n \n1.67% \n2014-15 \n \n46,023,290,342 \n \n2,301,164,517 \n \n47,810,000 \n \n2,253,354,517 \n \n2.08% \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNotes: \n(1) \nAssessed property value data can be found in Report \"Assessed Value of Taxable Property\u201d. \n(2) \nCalifornia Government Code, Section \u00a729909, states the total amount of bonded indebtedness shall not at any time \nexceed 5 percent of the taxable property of the county as shown by the last equalized assessment roll. \n(3) \nBonded debt financed with general governmental resources which include Pension Obligation Bonds. \n(4) \nThe legal debt margin is the County's available borrowing authority under state finance statutes and is calculated \nby subtracting the debt applicable to the legal debt limit from the legal debt limit. \nSource: Annual Comprehensive Financial Report Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2024.",

Although as a central services \ndepartment, County Counsel recovers net operating costs from user departments through the Countywide Cost Allocation Plan, \nthere are certain legal services provided to County departments, such as the Board of Supervisors, that are non-reimbursable \nunder the provisions of 2 the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 225 (formerly OMB Circular A-87). \nThe Recommended Budget includes a $79,022 net increase in revenues due to the following: \n\u2022 \nInterfund Legal Services reflects an increase of $36,100 for legal services provided to non-General Fund County departments \nbased on anticipated activity. \n\u2022 \nCountywide Administration Overhead reflects an increase of $124,590 for legal services provided to County departments. \n\u2022 \nLegal Fees and Other Charges for Services billed to outside agencies reflect a decrease of $81,668 due to changes in hourly \nrates charged as the result of personnel changes. \nPrimary Costs \nThe Recommended Budget includes a $103,943 net increase in appropriations primarily due to the following: \n\u2022 \nSalaries and Employee Benefits reflect an increase of $147,476 due to increases in wages, retirement, and health benefit \ncosts. \n\u2022 \nServices and Supplies reflect an increase of $10,165 primarily due to increases in insurance and software subscriptions costs. \n\u2022 \nOther Financing Uses reflect a decrease of $59,402 due to the full redemption of the Pension Obligation Bonds (POBs). \nDETAIL BY REVENUE\nAND APPROPRIATION\nPERCENT\nFUNCTIONAL AREA\nCHANGE\nREVENUES\n LEGAL SERVICES\n5,954,075\n \n6,334,215\n \n6,413,237\n \n79,022\n \n1.2%\nTOTAL REVENUES\n5,954,075\n \n6,334,215\n \n6,413,237\n \n79,022\n \n1.2%\nAPPROPRIATIONS\n LEGAL SERVICES\n6,286,533\n \n6,581,230\n \n6,685,173\n \n103,943\n \n1.6%\nTOTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n6,286,533\n \n6,581,230\n \n6,685,173\n \n103,943\n \n1.6%\nNET COUNTY COST\n LEGAL SERVICES\n332,458\n \n247,015\n \n271,936\n \n24,921\n \n10.1%\nNET COUNTY COST\n332,458\n \n247,015\n \n271,936\n \n24,921\n \n10.1%\nSTAFFING\nLEGAL SERVICES\n21\n21\n21\n0\n0.0%\nTOTAL STAFFING\n21\n21\n21\n0\n0.0%\nACTUAL\nBUDGET\nRECOMMENDED\nRECOMMENDED\n2024/25\nFROM\n2023/24\nADOPTED\n2025/26\nADOPTED TO\n\n1400 \u2013 Fund 001-County Counsel \nFunctional Area Summary \nBernadette Curry, County Counsel \nGeneral Counsel \n \n \n \nF-96 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nFixed Assets \nNone. \nDEPARTMENT COMMENTS \nThe matters handled by the office are varied and span from land use, economic development, behavioral health, workplace safety \nand labor issues. \nThe office has responded to and continues to address legal issues arising from a ballot initiative to rezone agricultural lands for \nthe development of a new community. Additionally, we work proactively to provide innovative legal solutions for on-going public \nand behavioral health issues, such as homelessness, legislation impacting behavioral health service delivery, and Community \nAssistance, Recovery and Empowerment (CARE) Court. Our extensive work with and for the County\u2019s most vulnerable populations \ncontinues focusing on identifying ways to provide care for those in need. \nA key priority is addressing local issues, including a continued focus on County\u2019s code enforcement matters. We aim to expand \nthe tools available to county staff to address code compliance issues, while also providing legal guidance to facilitate strategic \nland use and economic development in alignment with Board-identified priorities. Furthermore, the office has assumed control of \nthe County\u2019s General Liability and Property Insurance Programs and is working to identify strategies to contain costs in a volatile \nliability insurance market. \nIn addition to providing legal representation to all County departments, including services as hearing officers, the office continues \nto offer its expertise and legal services to outside governmental agencies. We currently provide legal representation to over 30 \nexternal clients, which are directly billed for services. These clients include transportation entities, levee, sewer and water districts, \nand resource conservation, reclamation, fire, and school districts. \nThe recommended Productive Hourly Rate (PHR) is $245 per hour, a 2% increase from the previous year. The increase is primarily \ndue to the previously discussed increases in salaries, employee benefits, and services and supplies expenditures. \nSOURCE OF FUNDS \n \nUSE OF FUNDS",

The General Liability Insurance Program \nprovides liability claims processing and claims management \nservices and oversees all civil litigation involving the County. \nThe Property Insurance Program ensures that all County \nproperty is covered by adequate property casualty, boiler \nand machinery, and earthquake insurance policies and \nworks on behalf of and with departments to recover losses \nfrom the County\u2019s insurer. \nBudget Summary: \nFY2024/25 Midyear Projection: \n21,754,648 \nFY2025/26 Recommended: \n26,983,120 \nCounty General Fund Contribution: \n0 \nPercent County General Fund Supported: \n0% \nTotal Employees (FTEs): \n0 \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nThe County participates in Public Risk Innovation, Solutions, and Management (PRISM), a member-directed insurance risk sharing \npool, for its general liability and property insurance coverage. Due to significant increases to premiums, an actuarial study was \nperformed in the fall of 2023 which indicated cost-savings could be realized by increasing the Self-Insured Retention (SIR) from \n$200,000 to $500,000. The Board approved that SIR increase on March 12, 2024. The $500,000 SIR pertains to claims and or \nlawsuits with a date of loss starting July 1, 2024. \nThe Property Insurance Program, having transferred from Human Resources to County Counsel effective July 1, 2024, centralized \nthe overall management of the County\u2019s insurance programs to include processing of claims, subrogation recoveries, and financial \ndocumentation. By combining the County\u2019s general liability and property insurance programs under one dedicated team, the \nCounty has achieved greater operational efficiencies as these programs have overlapping responsibilities. \nChallenges: \nAlthough the County purchases general liability insurance coverage through the PRISM pool, there are certain types of claims \nand some expenses that insurance will not cover, such as injunctive relief, contractual liability and litigation initiated by the County \nsuch as those relating to the Delta water issues. These costs, which include attorneys\u2019 fees and settlement costs, are not submitted \nunder the general liability coverage but are managed separately and recovered through charges allocated to departments. \nAccomplishments: \n\u2022 \nContinued proactive claims and litigation management and oversight to alleviate pressure on the County\u2019s insurance premium, \nthereby resulting in savings to departments for their allocated share of liability insurance costs. \n\u2022 \nObtained required information from various countywide sources to submit the General Liability, Cyber, Pollution, Special \nLiability Insurance Policy (SLIP) and Medical Malpractice Renewal Applications consistently before deadlines. \n\u2022 \nDeveloped standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the General Liability Insurance and Property Insurance Program \nproviding standardized instructions for requested and mid-year budget preparations, Cost Allocation Plans, Revenue \nGuidelines, Medical Malpractice Renewal Application and the processing of invoices, contracts and financial documents. \n\u2022 \nReviewed and provided recommendations for improvement to the General Liability Insurance Program and Property \nInsurance Program\u2019s Loss Contingency and Reserve Guidelines that improved the County\u2019s position for maintaining more \nappropriate levels of the loss contingency balance and Reserve funds and defined usage of available funds. \nWORKLOAD INDICATORS \nDuring FY2023/24: \n\u2022 \nReceived 122 separate Government Tort Claim Act claims filed against the County of which 66 were resolved without payment \nor liability to the County, 13 were settled pre-litigation, 25 are currently open awaiting expiration of suit filing statute, and 18 \nresulted in litigation. \n\u2022 \nActively managed 62 open lawsuits, of which 19 were dismissed or settled.",

Elections are scheduled in Solano County in November \nevery year, March or June in even years. Additional elections may be scheduled in April in even years, and March in odd years. \nMail ballot elections may be conducted in May and August of each year as well as in March of even-numbered years. Special \ninitiative, referendum, recall, and school bond elections are not limited to the regular election dates. \nCosts for federal, State, and County elections are borne by the County, while the other jurisdictions (cities, schools, and special \ndistricts) reimburse the County for the cost of conducting their elections. State special elections may be reimbursed at the \ndiscretion of the Legislature and Governor. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \n\u2022 \nROV continues to successfully conduct elections with multiple options for voters. During the previous year, ROV conducted \none election. Significant challenges included: \n\uf0a7 \nContinuing to provide safety and security of staff and over 1,100 poll workers. \n\uf0a7 \nContinued with expanded ballot drop-off locations for voters and picked up ballots daily from all locations. \n\uf0a7 \nSignificant increase in receipt of Vote by Mail ballots at drop-off locations and poll locations on election day. \n\u2022 \nContinued to work closely with the Secretary of State in 2024 and 2025 to implement business process improvements to the \nstatewide voter registration system known as \u201cVoteCal.\u201d ROV continues to work with the Secretary of State to improve \nduplicate match criteria to help reduce potential duplicate voters within the statewide voter registration system. \n\u2022 \nThe current schedule of elections provides for large gaps of time where community partners are not involved with County \noperations. ROV continues to work with election partners to increase \u201cadopted\u201d polling places by groups and organizations \n(100% of locations were adopted in the 2024 General Election). \n\u2022 \nElection preparations allowed staff to maintain a same-day processing schedule for all ballots received prior to election day. \nThis allowed for faster results released on election night, and fewer ballots to count post-election compared to other California \nCounties.",

Flanagan, Chief Information Officer \nElections \n \n \n \nF-116 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \n\u2022 \nContinued to experience an increase in voter registrations and re-registrations through the automatic Department of Motor \nVehicles (DMV) registration process. \nWORKLOAD INDICATORS \n\u2022 \nROV staff processed a total of 177,526 voter file transactions in FY2024/25. Of this number, 152,127 transactions were voters \nre-registering through DMV, National Change of Address (NCOA), or online voter registration forms. ROV maintains \nsignificant efficiencies through the increased use of online voter registration and the statewide VoteCal system. More than \n98% of all voter registration transactions are now handled via automated processing versus manual entry. \n\u2022 \nConsistent with previous years, 2024 Vote-by-Mail (VBM) turnout continued at a high level and comprises a significant portion \nof the work for the ROV office. All voters are considered VBM voters through state law. Turnout of in-person voting now \nrepresents only 9% of the overall turnout. Due to these changes, the ROV has increased services for VBM voters, providing \nmore 30-day locations to drop off ballots, plus more five-day curbside locations, and one 24-hour secure ballot box. \n\u2022 \nThe ROV experienced a significant increase in VBM returns on election day. Over 60% of vote by mail returns were dropped \noff on Election Day. The ROV continues to work on improvements to processes to increase VBM processing to handle the \nincreases on Election Day. \n\u2022 \nROV has implemented cross-training of staff between major election cycles which has required conducting multiple test or \nmock elections to ensure procedures are updated and the system works according to legislative requirements. \n \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents a decrease of $921,000 or 87.6% in revenues and a decrease of $314,600 or 3.7% in \nappropriations when compared to FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. As a result, the Net County Cost increased by $606,400 or 8.2%. \nPrimary Funding Sources \nThe primary funding sources for the division is General Fund, which is comprised of $8,007,627 or 98.4% of the Recommended \nBudget. \nThe Recommended Budget of $130,500 reflects a decrease of $921,000 in revenues primarily due to a decrease in filing fees and \nbillable election related charges for the June 2026 Gubernatorial Primary Election as compared to the billing of applicable districts \nDETAIL BY REVENUE\nAND APPROPRIATION\nPERCENT\nFUNCTIONAL AREA\nCHANGE\nREVENUES\n ELECTIONS\n367,941\n \n1,051,500\n \n130,500\n \n(921,000)\n \n (87.6%)\nTOTAL REVENUES\n367,941\n \n1,051,500\n \n130,500\n \n(921,000)\n \n (87.6%)\nAPPROPRIATIONS\n ELECTIONS\n7,144,250\n \n8,452,727\n \n8,138,127\n \n(314,600)\n \n (3.7%)\nTOTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n7,144,250\n \n8,452,727\n \n8,138,127\n \n(314,600)\n \n (3.7%)\nNET COUNTY COST\n ELECTIONS\n6,776,309\n \n7,401,227\n \n8,007,627\n \n606,400\n \n8.2%\nNET COUNTY COST\n6,776,309\n \n7,401,227\n \n8,007,627\n \n606,400\n \n8.2%\nSTAFFING\nELECTIONS\n9\n9\n9\n0\n0.0%\nTOTAL STAFFING\n9\n9\n9\n0\n0.0%\nACTUAL\nBUDGET\nRECOMMENDED\nRECOMMENDED\n2024/25\nFROM\n2023/24\nADOPTED\n2025/26\nADOPTED TO\n\nFunctional Area Summary \n1550 \u2013 Fund 001-Registrar of Voters \n \nTimothy P.

This is offset by anticipated grant revenue in the amount of $82,500 from the \nCalifornia Secretary of State to replace ROV operation-specific computers. \nPrimary Costs \nThe Recommended Budget of $8,138,127 reflects a decrease of $314,600 in appropriations primarily due to the following: \n\u2022 \nSalaries and Employee Benefits reflect an increase of $5,362 due to increases in wages, retirement, and health benefit costs, \noffset by a decrease in overtime costs based on current usage. \n\u2022 \nServices and Supplies reflect a decrease of $357,405 primarily due to decreases in election material and processing costs \n(paper, envelopes, forms, postage), offset by an increase in central data processing charges for additional Geographic \nInformation Systems (GIS) services required to maintain additional district boundaries for upcoming elections. \n\u2022 \nOther Charges reflect a decrease of $62,468 primarily due to a decrease in Countywide Administrative Overhead costs. \nCountywide Administrative Overhead costs for ROV fluctuate based on election cycles. \n\u2022 \nFixed Assets reflect an increase of $113,688 for the replacement of ROV operation-specific computers. \n\u2022 \nOther Financing Uses reflects a decrease of $14,877 due to the full redemption of the Pension Obligation Bonds (POBs). \nContracts \nThe FY2025/26 Recommended Budget includes the following significant contracts: \n\u2022 \n$232,265 for election equipment and supply deployment and retrieval. \n\u2022 \n$179,209 for annual maintenance and support services. \nFixed Assets \nThe FY2025/26 Recommended Budget includes the following fixed assets: \n\u2022 \n$128,451 for the replacement of ROV operation-specific computers, partially funded with State Grant Revenue. \nDEPARTMENT COMMENTS \nROV continues to review business process improvements to further streamline services and reduce operating costs where \npossible. \nROV is responsible for managing a significant increase in district boundaries. All districts participating in elections will submit new \nor updated district boundaries and will require verification from ROV to ensure ROV has the correct information before conducting \nthe next scheduled election for each district. This increased workload and subsequent election complexities has required the ROV \nto implement additional support from County GIS to manage the street updates, annexations, and perform an independent \nvalidation of correct assignment of voters within each district. \nROV continues to meet with stakeholders throughout the calendar year to discuss election process changes and how these \nchanges may impact the citizens of Solano County.",

Greve, Director of General Services \nPublic Ways \n \n \n \nF-134 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nDEPARTMENTAL PURPOSE \nThe General Services Department (GSD) is responsible for providing a safe, convenient, well-maintained regional airport for \ngeneral aviation and business aviation use. \nFUNCTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES \nThe Nut Tree Airport is located in Vacaville and serves both businesses and residents of Solano County and the surrounding \nregion by providing a safe and well-maintained airport which includes a runway, taxiways, tie-down areas, helicopter parking, \nCounty-owned hangars, ground lease space for privately-owned hangars, and office space for airport customers, businesses, and \nevents. The Airport Manager is responsible for planning and implementing airport capital projects funded primarily by federal and \nState grants in addition to administering the day-to-day maintenance and operation of the Airport. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nChallenges: \n\u2022 \nAll office and hangar spaces at the Airport are at full occupancy. The Airport\u2019s waiting list for hangar space is one to one and \na half years long. There is a slight decrease in the wait time when compared to past years but the list remains daunting for \npilots wanting space to house their aircraft. \n\u2022 \nAviation fuel prices remain volatile, causing a lower demand for fuel which has ultimately impacted Airport revenues. Volatile \nprices, and minimal storage capacity of Airport fuel tanks have also combined to create challenges for staff to maintain fuel \navailability for tenants and airport users. \n\u2022 \nThe underground storage tanks (UST) at the self-service island are 29 years old and nearing the end of their useful lifespan. \nThe airport needs to find a way to finance replacement tanks, which will include removal of the existing tanks and finalizing a \nnew location of the fuel island to better serve the tenants and aviation community. This type of project is not eligible for Federal \nAviation Administration (FAA) funding. \n\u2022 \nA total of 25 private hangar leases, originally executed for 30-year terms, are set to expire in 2025. Airport staff, in coordination \nwith County Counsel, are developing updated lease terms to reflect current market pricing. \n\u2022 \nThe security gate system is operating on obsolete software and hardware, both of which are no longer supported by the \nmanufacturer or a service provider. This creates a significant risk of gate failure and may impact airport security and access \ncontrol. \nAccomplishments: \n\u2022 \nThe Airport was awarded a $2.6 million FAA grant to fund Phase 2A of the Hangar Taxilane Reconstruction and Drainage \nProject. The Airport was also awarded a $130,354 Matching Grant from the California Department of Transportation to offset \nlocal share expenses for the reconstruction project. \n\u2022 \nAirport staff, in partnership with the Fire Marshal from the Vacaville Fire Protection District, conducted hangar inspections of \nmore than 131 County and privately-owned hangars \u2013 marking the second year of conducting Airport-wide inspections within \nthe past decade. Over 50 fire code violations were identified, many of which were corrected immediately. The overall number \nof violations continues to decrease, reducing potential fire risk and ensuring compliance with FAA grant assurance \nrequirements. \n\u2022 \nIn collaboration with Public Works, the Airport completed a crack seal treatment on the main parking lot in front of the \nAdministration Building to prevent further deterioration and extend the pavement\u2019s lifespan by up to eight years. \n\u2022 \nEnterprise Rent-A-Car agency began operations at the Airport in late July 2024. To manage the resulting increase in overflow \nvehicles, staff negotiated a contract with Enterprise to build a dedicated parking lot. The paved parking lot, completed in early \nDecember 2024, accommodates up to 30 vehicles and helps alleviate pressure on stakeholder parking. Additionally, the lot \ngenerates new revenue for the airport.",

Fuel sales for FY2025/26 are estimated to generate over $700,000 in Airport operating revenue. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents a decrease of $234,230 or 8.2% in revenues and an increase of $46,901 or 1.7% in \nappropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. \nPrimary Funding Sources \nThe Recommended Budget represents a net decrease of $234,230 in revenues primarily due to: \n\u2022 \nProperty Taxes reflect an increase of $64,651 due to an estimated increase of 3% in assessed values. \n\u2022 \nRevenue from Use of Money/Property reflects a decrease of $226,561 primarily due a decrease of $300,000 in long-term \nbuilding lease revenue. The FY2024/25 Adopted Budget for long-term building lease revenue was overstated. This decrease \nis offset by an increase in hangar, office and building rental revenues. \n\u2022 \nCharges for Services reflect a decrease of $100,000 due to reduced fuel and oil revenues. \n\u2022 \nMiscellaneous Revenues reflect an increase of $27,000 based on anticipated Enterprise parking fees and other charges. \n\u2022 \nOperating Transfers-In reflects no change from FY2024/25, representing transfers from the Special Aviation Fund (Fund 310) \nfor a grant from Caltrans. The grant agreement requires that the receipts and disbursements be accounted for in the Special \nAviation Fund. \nPrimary Costs \nThe Recommended Budget represents a net increase of $46,901 in appropriations primarily due to: \n\u2022 \nSalaries and Employee Benefits reflect an increase of $20,319 primarily due to increases in wages, retirement, and health \nbenefit costs. \n\u2022 \nServices and Supplies reflect an increase of $45,932 primarily due to increases in insurance, building maintenance, \nlandscaping and utilities costs, offset by a decrease in fuel purchases based on anticipated demand. \n\u2022 \nOther Charges reflect a decrease of $25,043 primarily due to a decrease in Countywide Administrative Overhead costs, \noffset by an increase in interest on long-term debt payable to the County General Fund. \n\u2022 \nLeases reflect a decrease of $10,440 due to a decrease in fuel truck lease costs. \n\u2022 \nOther Financing Uses reflect an increase of $18,633 primarily due to an Operating Transfers-Out to Airport Special Projects \n(BU 9010) to support the local share of three Airport projects. \nContracts \nThe FY2025/26 Recommended Budget includes the following significant contracts: \n\u2022 \n$650,000 for AvGas and Jet fuel purchases. \n\u2022 \n$75,000 for engineering and architectural services. \n\n9000 \u2013 Fund 047-Airport \nSummary of Other Administered Budgets \nMegan M. Greve, Director of General Services \nPublic Ways \n \n \n \nF-136 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nFixed Assets \nThe FY2025/26 Recommended Budget includes the following fixed asset: \n\u2022 \n$7,500 for a sweeper unit to keep the airport pavement clean and swept of any debris. \nDEPARTMENT COMMENTS \nNone. \n \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS \nNone. \nSUMMARY OF POSITION CHANGES \nThere are no changes in position allocation. \nPENDING ISSUES AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS \nAt this time, it is unclear if the budget will be impacted by price increases on fuel and other necessary supplies in running the \nAirport. Airport staff will continue to evaluate the impacts of inflation and will provide necessary revisions when verified. \nAdditionally, the recent passage of Senate Bill 1193, which prohibits the sale of leaded aviation fuel at airports beginning January \n1, 2031, presents a significant long-term challenge. Given that most fixed-wing aircraft at the Nut Tree Airport currently operate \non 100 low lead fuel, this regulation change could have considerable implications for the Airport\u2019s aviation community. While \ngeneral aviation stakeholders are actively pursuing safe and cost-effective alternatives, the current supply of unleaded aviation \nfuel is limited. Airport staff are closely monitoring the situation and will continue to engage with partners and regulatory agencies \nto support a smooth and practical solution. \nDETAIL BY REVENUE\nCATEGORY AND\nAPPROPRIATION CATEGORY\n2023/24 ACTUALS\n2024/25\nADOPTED\nBUDGET\n2025/26\nRECOMMENDED\nFROM\nADOPTED TO\nRECOMMENDED\nPERCENT\nCHANGE\nREVENUES\nTAXES\n608,309\n599,315\n663,966\n64,651\n10.8%\nREVENUE FROM USE OF MONEY/PROP\n1,067,211\n1,363,155\n1,136,594\n(226,561)\n(16.6%)\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL REV STATE\n3,488\n3,730\n3,730\n0\n0.0%\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL REV FEDERAL\n11\n0\n0\n0\n0.0%\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL REV OTHER\n680\n0\n680\n680\n0.0%\nCHARGES FOR SERVICES\n698,611\n825,000\n725,000\n(100,000)\n(12.1%)\nMISC REVENUE\n93,775\n41,000\n68,000\n27,000\n65.9%\nOTHER FINANCING SOURCES\n10,000\n10,000\n10,000\n0\n0.0%\nTOTAL REVENUES\n2,482,083\n2,842,200\n2,607,970\n(234,230)\n(8.2%)\nAPPROPRIATIONS\nSALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\n472,829\n508,630\n528,949\n20,319\n4.0%\nSERVICES AND SUPPLIES\n1,076,832\n1,382,737\n1,428,669\n45,932\n3.3%\nOTHER CHARGES\n493,822\n685,186\n660,143\n(25,043)\n(3.7%)\nF/A EQUIPMENT\n6,072\n10,000\n7,500\n(2,500)\n(25.0%)\nLEASES\n25,091\n37,203\n26,763\n(10,440)\n(28.1%)\nOTHER FINANCING USES\n215,426\n215,658\n234,291\n18,633\n8.6%\nTOTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n2,290,072\n2,839,414\n2,886,315\n46,901\n1.7%\n NET GAIN(LOSS)\n192,011\n2,786\n(278,345)\n(281,131)\n(10090.9%)\nSTAFFING\nAIRPORT\n3\n \n3\n \n3\n \n0\n0.0%\nTOTAL STAFFING\n3\n \n3\n \n3\n \n0\n0.0%",

Due to competing priorities among \nairports, the grant award was delayed the past two fiscal years. Award notification is anticipated in fall 2025. \n\u2022 \nThe Airport was awarded a $2.6 million FAA grant to fund the next phase of construction of the Northeast Hangar Taxilane \nReconstruction and Drainage project. In addition, a $130,354 matching grant was awarded by the California Department of \nTransportation to offset the local share of project expenses. Construction is expected to begin in late May 2025, with \ncompletion expected by August 2025. The project will address deteriorated pavement across six hangar taxilanes and resolve \nlongstanding drainage issues between hangar buildings. \n\u2022 \nThe Airport has applied for a $427,500 FAA grant and entitlement funds to design electrical system upgrades. These include \nimprovements to runway and taxiway edge lighting, apron lighting, and rotating beacon replacement, as recommended by \nthe 2024 electrical assessment. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents no revenues and no appropriations for FY2025/26, resulting in no change in Fund Balance. \nAny funded projects which are not completed are carried forward or are re-budgeted in the succeeding year increasing the total \nappropriation and revenue in the Working Budget. \nPrimary Funding Sources \nThe primary funding sources for Airport Special Projects include FAA and State grants. No new grants are included in the \nRecommended Budget. Should any grants be received, the Airport will bring forward any necessary budget adjustments as part \nof the Midyear Financial Report. \nPrimary Costs \nThe primary costs for the Airport Special Projects are for construction-related improvements to the Nut Tree Airport. There are \ncurrently four multi-year capital projects in various phases including Runway/Taxiway Apron Electrical Assessment; ALP Update, \nAGIS, and Aviation Activity Forecast; Airport Taxiway Rehabilitation; and PMMP Pavement Management Plan Update. \nFixed Assets \nNone. \nDEPARTMENT COMMENTS \nNone.",

Flanagan, Chief Information Officer \n \nOther General \n \n \n \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nF-145 \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents an increase of $1,240,678 or 2.7% in revenues and an increase of $152,991 or 0.3% in \nappropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. \nThe increase in appropriations is primarily due to the timing of expenses for a multi-year project to update the County\u2019s public \nsafety radio system to Project 25 (P25) standards, increases in insurance and Salaries and Employee Benefits resulting from \nincreases in retirement and health benefit costs. \nPrimary Funding Sources \nThe department is an Internal Service Fund and as such its primary funding source is through charges for services to County \ndepartments and other agencies. The department\u2019s cost plan assumes that revenues will equal expenses within the accounting \nperiod with an allowance for working capital and capital asset expenditures, which are charged to departments based on standard \ndepreciation schedules. The $1,073,622 draw on fund balance is primarily due to revenues for the P25 system upgrade for which \nrevenue was received in FY2024/25. \nPrimary Costs \nThe department\u2019s three primary cost centers include: \n\u2022 \nInfrastructure/Network/IT Security which is comprised of DoIT Administration and Infrastructure. \n\u2022 \nApplications Development Management and Support, which is comprised of Law & Justice Applications Systems, H&SS \nApplication Systems, Management Information Systems, Land Information Management Systems, Web Application Systems, \nand Geographic Application Systems \n\u2022 \nCommunications which is comprised of Telecommunications, and Public Safety Radio Communication \nThe Recommended Budget continues to focus on maintenance and support of current systems with limited development of new \nsystems to support high-priority department objectives and State and federal mandates.

Flanagan, Chief Information Officer \n \nOther General \n \n \n \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nF-151 \nFUNCTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES \nThis budget was been established to track separately the costs for the replacement of the Solano County property tax system \nwhich was initially created in 1982. The technology platform of the original system reached obsolescence over 22 years ago and \nit was re-architected with a combination of modern components and emulation technologies that allow much of the system to mimic \nthe way the old technology worked. The re-architected system was placed in production use in 2010. In 2017, the Board approved \na loan for the County General Fund to fund a multi-year multi department project to replace the Solano County Integrated Property \nSystems (SCIPS). \nImplementation of the new property tax system, County Assessment and Taxation System (CATS), was planned over a three-year \nperiod and across fourteen phases of work and went live on March 1, 2023. The system went live in FY2022/23, and costs related \nto the SCIPS replacement project were funded by the Board approved loan and are currently recovered via user charges. \nThe following shows the drawdowns from this loan: \nProject Funding: \n \n$10,000,000 \nActual Cost Through FY2023/24: \n $9,476,617 \nExpected Costs for FY2024/25: \n $523,383 \nRequested Budget FY2025/26: \n $0 \nBalance Remaining: \n \n $0 \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nChallenges: \nWhile the new CATS system went live in March 2023, staff continues to address outstanding functional needs that are required by \nuser departments, including reporting. \nAccomplishments: \n\u2022 \nIn March 2023, the County went \u201clive\u201d on the new property tax system, the County Assessment and Taxation System (CATS) \nProject. The County Assessor\u2019s Office worked with the Department of Information Technology (DoIT), the Tax Collector, and \nthe Auditor-Controller to implement the CATS project, replacing the Solano County Integrated Property System (SCIPS). The \nCATS Project is a more integrated and efficient property tax system. \n\u2022 \nStaff continued post go-live activities of the new property tax system including refining functionality and reporting required by \nuser departments. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents a decrease of $717,764 or 100.0% in revenues and a decrease of $1,090,101 or 100.0% \nin appropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. The Recommended Budget represents no revenues and no \nappropriations for FY2025/26 as the new CATS system went live in March 2023. All ongoing system costs are reflected in the \nDoIT operating budget (Fund 370 \u2013 BU 1870). \nFixed Assets \nNone.",

Additionally, recent and potential future reductions in federal \nfunding may impact the County\u2019s ability to leverage grant programs to support capital projects. For example, this past spring, the \nCounty experienced a significant reduction to the federal Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity (ELC) grant, which supports \ncritical public health infrastructure. \nDuring the past winter, the County received a final public notice of intent to award hazard mitigation grant funding through the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and California Office of Emergency Services\u2019 (Cal OES). If awarded, this \nfunding will help offset the cost of eligible capital projects focused on hazard mitigation. \nThe State has also submitted draft terms for acquisition of the County-owned Hall of Justice site located at 550/600 Union Street \nin Fairfield, to support development of a replacement facility for the Solano County Superior Court. County staff continue to \ncoordinate with the Judicial Council of California and the Solano Superior Court to assist in refining terms of sale, identifying interim \nhousing solutions for displaced programs, and mitigate impacts to ongoing County operations during construction. \n \n \nDETAIL BY REVENUE\nCATEGORY AND\nAPPROPRIATION CATEGORY\n2023/24\n ACTUAL\n2024/25 \nADOPTED\nBUDGET\n2025/26\nRECOMMENDED\nFROM\nADOPTED TO\nRECOMMENDED\nPERCENT\nCHANGE\nREVENUES\nTAXES\n4,127,775\n4,003,775\n4,504,011\n500,236\n12.5%\nREVENUE FROM USE OF MONEY/PROP\n2,741,133\n2,184,000\n2,060,000\n(124,000)\n(5.7%)\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL REV STATE\n3,070,422\n3,153,556\n3,196,336\n42,780\n1.4%\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL REV FEDERAL\n72\n150\n150\n0\n0.0%\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL REV OTHER\n4,610\n3,000\n3,000\n0\n0.0%\nMISC REVENUE\n0\n4,039,160\n0\n(4,039,160)\n(100.0%)\nOTHER FINANCING SOURCES\n3,331,110\n5,220,568\n866,516\n(4,354,052)\n(83.4%)\nGENERAL FUND CONTRIBUTION\n31,308,108\n10,798,952\n7,818,500\n(2,980,452)\n(27.6%)\nTOTAL REVENUES\n44,583,231\n29,403,161\n18,448,513\n(10,954,648)\n(37.3%)\nAPPROPRIATIONS\nSERVICES AND SUPPLIES\n1,145,686\n3,343,822\n1,239,426\n(2,104,396)\n(62.9%)\nOTHER CHARGES\n1,019,411\n1,095,825\n835,128\n(260,697)\n(23.8%)\nF/A LAND\n5,194,617\n0\n0\n0\n0.0%\nF/A BLDGS AND IMPRMTS\n9,238,603\n12,599,912\n13,316,016\n716,104\n5.7%\nF/A EQUIPMENT\n4,068,189\n3,711,351\n135,000\n(3,576,351)\n(96.4%)\nOTHER FINANCING USES\n2,912,991\n4,900,000\n1,766,626\n(3,133,374)\n(63.9%)\nTOTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n23,579,497\n25,650,910\n17,292,196\n(8,358,714)\n(32.6%)\nNET CHANGE\n(21,003,733)\n(3,752,251)\n(1,156,317)\n2,595,934\n(69.2%)",

Greve, Director of General Services \nPromotion \n \n \n \n \nG-12 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nFUNCTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES \nThe purpose of the Public Art Projects Fund is to account for the purchase or commission of public art and the maintenance of \npublic art within designated public areas owned by the County (Ordinance No. 1639, Chapter 5, and Section 5.5-5.6). The County \nbudgets for public art in County facilities to promote the arts and culture in Solano County. For capital construction projects in \nexcess of $1 million, 1.5% of construction costs, at the time of the initial contract award (excluding maintenance projects), is \nallocated for public art. In addition, 5% of the 1.5% is to be reserved for maintenance of the public art projects. \nFunds appropriated to this Fund will be used for: design services of artists; selection, acquisition, purchase, commissioning, \ninstallation, examination and/or display of artworks; maintenance of artworks; education concerning the artwork; and administrative \ncosts of the Art Committee in connection with the Art Program. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nChallenges: \nIdentification of a sufficient funding source for maintenance of public art is needed. Also, longer-term restoration costs for certain \ndeteriorating works and associated logistical challenges of performing restoration under the supervision of the original artist \nremains challenging. \nAccomplishments: \nNo activities in FY2024/25 because the approved capital projects did not include public art components. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents an increase of $310 or 38.8% in revenues and an increase of $2,182 or 4.8% in \nappropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. \nThere is no funding for new public art projects in FY2025/26. The appropriations represent Countywide Administrative Overhead \nand maintenance costs for existing public art. The revenues reflect estimated interest income and an Operating Transfers-In from \nthe Accumulated Capital Outlay Fund to fund Countywide Administrative Overhead costs. \nFixed Assets \nNone. \nSee related Budget Unit 9402 \u2013 Fund 106 Contingencies (refer to Contingencies section of the Budget). \n \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS \nNone. \nDETAIL BY REVENUE\nCATEGORY AND\nAPPROPRIATION CATEGORY\n2023/24\n ACTUAL\n2024/25 \nADOPTED\nBUDGET\n2025/26\nRECOMMENDED\nFROM\nADOPTED TO\nRECOMMENDED\nPERCENT\nCHANGE\nREVENUES\nREVENUE FROM USE OF MONEY/PROP\n1,847\n800\n1,000\n200\n25.0%\nOTHER FINANCING SOURCES\n0\n0\n110\n110\n100.0%\nTOTAL REVENUES\n1,847\n800\n1,110\n310\n38.8%\nAPPROPRIATIONS\nSERVICES AND SUPPLIES\n0\n45,838\n47,838\n2,000\n4.4%\nOTHER CHARGES\n1,157\n(72)\n110\n182\n252.8%\nTOTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n1,157\n45,766\n47,948\n2,182\n4.8%\nNET COUNTY COST\n(690)\n44,966\n46,838\n1,872\n4.2%",

It is recommended that this budget unit be used to pay for the \ninitial design permitting process and site preparation started in FY2017/18. This multiyear project is a cooperative effort between \nthe County, City of Vallejo, and the Solano County Fair Association (SCFA) that began in 2008. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nBackground: \nIn FY2008/09, the County entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the City of Vallejo regarding the redevelopment of \nthe Fairgrounds. The Board of Supervisors (Board) initially established an Ad-Hoc Fairgrounds Committee and authorized the \nAuditor-Controller to establish an initial loan of $2.0 million from the County General Fund for the development of a Vision for the \nsite which became known as the Solano360 Vision. \nIn FY2009/10, the Board increased the loan for the Project to an amount not to exceed $4.4 million, and in coordination with the \nVallejo City Council, authorized the Project team to proceed with Phase II of the Project. Phase II included the preparation of a \nSpecific Plan for the site with associated studies and reports and the preparation of an environmental document. \nThe Board approved a Project Budget in February 2010, and in May 2010, authorized the first of several professional service \nagreements to advance the planning effort. \nIn FY2010/11, the Project team was modified to bring in a new Project Manager to coordinate the Project consultants, and staff \nfrom both the County and the City of Vallejo, to focus on the work required for a Specific Plan, Environmental Impact Report (EIR), \nDevelopment Agreement and Tentative Map for the Project known as the Solano360 Specific Plan. \nThe Notice of Preparation (NOP) for the EIR was issued on September 9, 2011, and the comment period on the NOP was extended \nthrough October 26, 2011. The Draft Specific Plan, Draft EIR, Draft Public Facilities Financing Plan and Draft Fiscal Impact \nAnalysis were released for public review on November 9, 2012, and the comment period on the Draft EIR ended on January 10, \n2013. \nIn FY2012/13, the Solano360 Committee, which served as the project oversight and consisted of two board members, three city \ncouncil members, and three Solano County Fair Board members met periodically to review and take public comment on the \nconsultant work. The Solano360 project was reviewed in 19 public meetings and there were five presentations before the Vallejo \nCity Council, a joint Vallejo City Council-Planning Commission meeting held on January 7, 2013 to receive public input on the \nproject, and a public workshop on the financial aspects of the project on February 7, 2013. There have been over 40 Fair Board \nmeetings at which the project was discussed. Staff has also been before the Board 14 times on various project-related issues and \nhas maintained a County website on the project. \nThe Board conducted a public hearing on the draft Specific Plan, associated studies, and draft EIR/EIS documents at a joint \nsession with the Solano County Fair Board on December 11, 2012. The Vallejo City Council held a joint meeting with its Planning \nCommission on January 7, 2013 to receive feedback on the documents. The City of Vallejo facilitated a community workshop on \nFebruary 7, 2013 to further discuss the fiscal impact of the Project in Vallejo. \nOn February 26, 2013, the Board certified the Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) for the Project and approved the \nSolano360 Specific Plan and recommended that application be sent to the City of Vallejo for the Development Agreement and \nTentative Map. On April 29, 2013, the Vallejo City Planning Commission approved the Tentative Map for the Project and \nrecommended approval of the Specific Plan, Development Agreement, Vallejo General Plan Amendments and Zoning \nAmendments to the Vallejo City Council. The Vallejo City Council approved the Solano360 Specific Plan, a tentative map, and the \nDevelopment Agreement on May 14, 2013. \nIn FY2013/14, the Project team, after engaging the services of three consultants (MacKay & Somps, ENGEO, and First Carbon \nSolutions), began the preliminary design of Phase 1A of the Project which included the preparation of the required environmental \nsurveys and wetland delineations, the geotechnical analysis, and the preliminary engineering for the Project. \nIn FY2014/15, the County received a Conditional Letter of Map Revision from the Federal Emergency Management Agency which \nis the first milestone in removing the Phase 1 work from a flood plain.",

In consultation with the Implementation Committee, a Request for \nQualifications for the development of Solano360 was issued on December 23, 2014, and proposals were submitted on March 13, \n2015 and presented to the committee. The committee recommendation was forwarded to the Board on April 14, 2015. Staff was \ndirected to proceed with negotiating an Exclusive Right to Negotiate (ERN) Agreement with the selected proposer, Solano \nCommunity Development, LLC (SCD). The ERN was executed in May 2015 with an initial term of nine months. \nIn FY2015/16, staff worked with SCD on development of their proposed land plan for utilization of all or a portion of the 149.1-acre \nproject site. SCD proposed to develop uses consistent with the Solano360 Specific Plan, which initially included an Exposition \nHall, Retail Shops, Amphitheatre, Hotel, Sports Fields, and Fair of Future venues organized along an iconic water feature that \nincludes a public promenade. On January 26, 2016, the Board agreed to a 2-month extension of the ERN to allow SCD to further \nrefine their land plan and develop a market study. On March 22, 2016, the Board, upon receipt of the updated land plan and \nmarket study granted a second extension through October 25, 2016 to allow the developer to finalize the land plan and coordinate \nwith the County on a project phasing plan, facilities financing plan and Lease Disposition and Developer Agreement. The project \nteam provided progress updates to the City of Vallejo and the Solano360 Implementation Committee as well as pursuing \njurisdictional and permitting requirements through the County\u2019s engineering and environmental consultants. \nIn FY2016/17, staff continued discussions with SCD under the ERN for their proposed utilization of the 149.1-acre project site. \nStaff and its consultants analyzed SCD\u2019s proposed land concepts, uses and phasing; proposed financial models; and development \nof key terms to validate compliance with the Specific Plan and County goals for the Solano360 project. The Board provided two \nextensions to the ERN with SCD, including an extension to expire on June 27, 2017. On a concurrent path, staff continued with \nenvironmental and engineering evaluations to pursue jurisdictional clearance of the entire project site as well as development of \nbid documents for demolition of the grandstands, horse barns and ancillary structures. Staff worked with the Solano Transportation \nAuthority (STA) and the City of Vallejo on an amended and restated funding agreement for the Solano360 project share of offsite \nimprovements identified as mitigation measures in the Specific Plan FEIR for the Redwoods Parkway and Fairgrounds Drive \nImprovement project. \nIn FY2017/18, the County entered into an amended and restated funding agreement with the STA and the City of Vallejo and \nagreed to provide $750,000 to begin pre-design and design documentation for the Redwoods Parkway and Fairgrounds Drive \nImprovement project. \nThe Board made the determination to not renew the Exclusive Right to Negotiate with SCD, LLC. The County continued to evaluate \nits options with regards to the future implementation of the Solano360 Specific Plan which included demolition/clean-up of specific \nareas of the site, targeted upgrades to existing facilities and potential solicitation of a new developer(s) for the 149.1-acre project \nsite. \nIn April of 2018, the County solicited and received bids for the demolition of grandstands, horse barns and ancillary structures and \nawarded the contract for demolition in June 2018. \nIn FY2018/19, demolition of the grandstands, horse barns and ancillary structures was completed and site grading to collect site \nstorm water was performed including installation of associated storm water conveyance infrastructure. The Project experienced \nsome delays due to wildfires in neighboring counties, which impacted PG&E\u2019s ability to demolish utility infrastructure and was \nanticipated to issue a Notice of Completion in early FY2019/20. \nIn FY2019/20, the Board issued the Notice of Completion for the demolition of the grandstands, horse barns and ancillary \nstructures and improvements for site grading. In January of 2020, the County, in conjunction with the City of Vallejo, issued a \nRequest for Qualifications (RFQ) for development of the Solano360 Specific Plan. Four responses were received, but due to \noperational impacts as a result of COVID-19, the review process of the four developer submittals continued into FY2020/21. \nIn FY2020/21, County staff, City of Vallejo staff, and a representative from the Solano Economic Development Corporation \nreviewed responses to the Request for Proposals for development of the 149.1 acre Fairgrounds site and after evaluation by the \nSolano360 Implementation Committee, selected IRG/JLL as the preferred development team for the Solano360 development and \nrecommended that the Board enter into an Exclusive Right to Negotiate (ERN) Agreement with IRG/JLL. The committee \nrecommendation was forwarded to the Board on November 17, 2020 and staff was directed to proceed with negotiating an ERN \nwith the selected proposer, IRG/JLL. The ERN was fully executed in January 2021 with an initial term of nine months. Staff \ncontinued to work with IRG/JLL on their proposed land uses with the goal of entering a long-term ground lease for the site.",

Staff aimed to bring forward an \nupdated land plan and a Lease Disposition and Development Agreement (LDDA) and other associated agreements to the Board \nin Fall of 2021. \nIn FY2021/22, County staff continued working with IRG/JLL under the ERN agreement approved in 2020, amending this \nagreement through September 30, 2022 to allow for completion of work. IRG filed a Specific Plan amendment with the City of \nVallejo, which was under review, then placed on hold. Staff continued to work with IRG/JLL on entering into a long-term ground \nlease for the site. Staff continued discussions with PG&E on relocation of a gas line, and with the Vallejo Flood and Wastewater \nDistrict on water, sewer, and storm drainage needs. \nIn FY2022/23, County staff engaged in ongoing negotiations with IRG under the ERN agreement approved in 2020, amending \nthis agreement through August 1, 2023 to allow for the completion of work. IRG worked towards a revised project description and \nSpecific Plan update with the City of Vallejo. Staff continued to work with IRG on finalizing a long-term ground lease and \ndevelopment agreement for the site. Staff continued discussions with PG&E on relocation of a gas line, and with the Vallejo Flood \nand Wastewater District on water, sewer, and storm drainage needs. The County approved American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) \nfunds totaling $5.0 million toward implementation of channel restoration work around the perimeter of the site. Staff continued \npursuing transit improvements with the STA. \nIn FY2023/24, County staff continued to work with IRG under the ERN agreement approved in 2020, extending this agreement \nthrough December 31, 2023 to allow for the completion of work. The County and IRG ERN discussions slowed to allow time for \nthe County to receive a determination from California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) regarding the \nimpact of recent legislation changes related to the Surplus Lands Act. While HCD determination is pending, County staff continues \nto make progress in the area with the ARPA-funded channel improvement project and is working with the STA on the SR-\n37/Fairgrounds Drive improvement project. The County, through Solano County Public Works, is also proceeding with the Mobility \nHub project including a new parking area, electric vehicle charging stations, and a transit stop near the northern portion of the \nFairgrounds property along Sage Street consistent with improvements anticipated in the Specific Plan. IRG worked to finalize a \nrevised project description and Specific Plan update with the City of Vallejo. Pending resolution with HCD, staff will resume \ndiscussions with IRG on finalizing a long-term ground lease and development agreement for the site. Staff is still in discussions \nwith PG&E on relocation of a gas line, and with the Vallejo Flood and Wastewater District on water, sewer, and storm drainage \nneeds. \nIn FY2024/25, County staff, the City of Vallejo, and the STA partnered on various project development phases and delivery of the \ncurrent Highway 37/Fairgrounds Drive Improvement Project (\u201cProject\u201d). The Project will provide congestion, mobility, transit, and \nsafety enhancements at the Fairgrounds Drive and Highway 37 interchange, including roadway corridor improvements in front of \nthe Solano County Fairgrounds. On June 11, 2024, the County and the STA entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) \nthat established funding commitments for completing construction of the Project. As the lead delivery agency, the STA put a \nconstruction contract out to bid in Fall of 2024 and received a low bid at $31 million, approximately $6.173 million over budget. \nThe STA was able to obtain $5.5 million in Regional Measure 3 Bridge Toll funds to execute the construction contract but still \nrequires $850,000 in additional local funds to fully fund the construction gap. On April 8, 2025, the Board approved an amendment \nto the MOA to facilitate full construction funding. The amendment provided the Project with $500,000 in additional Transportation \nDevelopment Act Article 4 funds and $350,000 in Regional Transportation Impact Fee funds from the County\u2019s funding allotments \nfor the construction contract. STA proposed a funding swap by repurposing $850,000 in remaining federal earmark funds from the \nProject to the County\u2019s Mobility Hub Project at the Fairgrounds. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents no change to revenues and a decrease of $105,138 or 1.1% in appropriations when \ncompared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. The appropriations will be used for continued coordination of the Solano360 project, \nconsultant services, permit fees, infrastructure/site improvements and demolition costs for unused/obsolete facilities on an as \nneeded basis as determined by the Board.

The fee is imposed on all new non-exempt construction within all incorporated and unincorporated areas \nof Solano County. The fee, set under the authority of Government Code (GC) \u00a766000-66009, was implemented through County \nOrdinance 1466 adopted on February 9, 1993. The purpose of the fee is to provide funding for expansion and/or new construction \nof County facilities required to accommodate new demands for facilities needed to house government services in the County. \nFees collected under the Ordinance provide funding for needs assessments, planning, designing, construction, lease-purchase, \nacquisition, improvements, fixed assets and furnishings for County services, including jails, justice services, general \nadministration, public and mental health services, public assistance services, regional transportation, County parks, libraries and \nanimal shelters. \nThe Department of General Services oversees the PFF program budget and is responsible for administering the disbursement of \nfunds. The County Administrator\u2019s Office acts as the liaison between the County and the incorporated cities that collect the fees \nfor the County related to all construction within city limits. \nIn FY2019/20, Solano County completed a 5-year Public Facilities Fee Study required by the Mitigation Fee Act (GC \u00a766000, et. \nseq), resulting in an update to the Public Facilities Fee rates. The County is working with a consultant on a new Public Facilities \nFee Study for FY2025/26. The amounts in this Recommended Budget are based on the FY2019/20 Study. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \n\u2022 \nSolano County collects PFF in six categories: Countywide Public Protection (including Courts), Health and Social Services, \nLibrary, General Government, and Regional Transportation Part A and Part B. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents an increase of $2,767,807 or 41.7% in revenues and an increase of $401,162 or 23.4% in \nappropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. The increase in revenues is the result of a projected increase \nin fee collections due to a projected increase in construction and an increase in interest income. The increase in appropriations is \nprimarily due to an increase in contributions from PFF Vacaville Library District Division (BU 1764) to the Vacaville Library District \nbased on available Fund Balance. \nAppropriations include: \n\u2022 \n$724,164 Operating Transfers-Out from the PFF Public Protection Division (BU 1761) to COP Debt Service (BU 8037) used \nto finance the Probation Facility and improvements to the Central Utility Plant. \n\u2022 \n$576,851 Operating Transfers-Out to COP Debt Service (BU 8037) used to finance the County Administration Center (CAC) \nand improvements to the Central Utility Plant. \n\u2022 \n$75,000 OperatingTransfers-Out to the Road Fund (BU 3010) to transfer revenue designated for Regional Transportation \nImpact Fee (RTIF) towards an outstanding General Fund loan. \n\u2022 \n$670,850 from PFF Vacaville Library District Division (BU 1764) to the Vacaville Library District for facility expansion and \nrelated debt. \n\u2022 \n$69,233 for accounting, auditing, Countywide Administrative Overhead, legal, and other professional services. \nFixed Assets \nNone. \nSee related Budget Unit 9124 \u2013 Fund 296 Contingencies (refer to Contingencies section of the Budget).",

A wide variety of \nactivities are undertaken by the department to achieve these objectives, including: establishing paternity, which may include \ngenetic testing, locating parents and their income and assets, obtaining court-ordered child support and health insurance \ncoverage, enforcing monthly and past due child support utilizing appropriate enforcement tools, modifying existing child support \norders, working with the State Disbursement Unit to collect and distribute child support payments, and conducting complaint \nresolution and formal hearings. DCSS partners with parents and guardians to set realistic child support orders that allow steady \nand reliable income for the child and family. For underemployed or unemployed parents, services are available to assist parents \nin finding sustainable work through a partnership with the Workforce Development Board. \nIn keeping with a program recognized for providing economic stability for low-income families, all parents and guardians, \nregardless of income or immigration status, are eligible for child support services. Research has shown that the child support \nprogram is among the most effective means of reducing child poverty and improving outcomes for children. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nChallenges: \nOn January 10, 2025, Governor Newsom released the FY2025/26 Governor\u2019s Proposed Budget. There was no change from the \ncurrent fiscal year State Budget to the FY2025/26 Governor\u2019s Proposed Budget for the California Child Support Program. However, \nin FY2024/25, Solano DCSS received a funding reduction of approximately $184,500 and that funding reduction continues into \nFY2025/26. Solano DCSS, again, is unable to absorb annual cost increases for FY2025/26 without an increase in State funding. \nIt is currently unknown if any additional funding cuts to Solano DCSS\u2019 State funding will be implemented due to the catastrophic \nfires in the Los Angeles area and the economic impact of that disaster on State resources.",

The updated \nallocation calculation reflects that additional State funds should be allocated to Solano DCSS; however, due to no additional State \nfunding for the California Child Support Program in the FY2025/26 Governor\u2019s Proposed Budget, the department will not receive \nany additional funding for FY2025/26. \nOf the 47 LCSAs within California, 35 LCSAs are considered \u201cunderfunded.\u201d The current budget allocation methodology, which \ngoverns the distribution of additional State funding to LCSAs, is based on a cases to Full Time Equivalent (FTE) ratio. The current \nratio sets 181 cases per FTE as a threshold to determine which county child support departments in California are eligible for \nadditional funding when available. According to the methodology, Solano DCSS continues to remain underfunded; therefore, the \ndepartment is understaffed. Until the department receives additional State funding, Solano DCSS will continue to fund annual cost \nincreases by holding vacancies, evaluating them carefully, and only filling positions that are deemed necessary and essential to \nthe department\u2019s core business functions. This analysis is done by reviewing compliance timeframes, regulations, and statutes to \nensure the department continues to abide by mandated requirements and the terms of Solano DCSS Plans of Cooperation with \nthe CA DCSS and the Superior Court. For FY2025/26, Solano DCSS will be underfunded by approximately $1.05 million. \nAccomplishments: \n\u2022 \nDistributed $40,278,312 in child support payments in the Federal Fiscal Year (FFY) 2023/24, an increase of nearly $56,000 \nfrom the prior year. \n\u2022 \nAchieved an establishment rate of 94% on cases with support orders established, a collection rate of 65% on cases with past \ndue child support, a collection rate of 64% on cases with current child support owed, and an overall cost effectiveness of \n$3.08 which exceeds the Statewide average of $2.68. \n\u2022 \nThe Child Support Director\u2019s Association (CSDA) awarded Solano DCSS with the Innovation Award in May of 2024 for the \nFlexible Case Management Program. This approach, which works to address the everchanging needs of the families served \nby providing a more personalized approach to case management, has been shared with CA DCSS and modeled in other \ncounties based on the success that the department continues to have. \n\u2022 \nIn March 2025, Solano DCSS, in partnership with the Solano County Superior Court, began a pilot program to increase \nawareness about the child support program by offering access to child support services in all family law departments. The \ndepartment\u2019s goal is to reach new customers who may be unaware of the program and the services Solano DCSS provides \nto better serve the children in the community. \nWORKLOAD INDICATORS \n\u2022 \nDuring the period of October 2023 through September 2024 (FFY2023/24), Solano DCSS opened and administered 2,091 \nnew child support cases through referrals from Solano County Health and Social Services or from applications received via \nthe internet, mail, or in person. This is almost a 100% increase from the prior FFY; however, even with this increase in case \nopenings, Solano DCSS managed a caseload of 12,821, which is a 5% decrease from the prior FFY caseload size. This is \nhigher than the statewide average decline in caseload of 3.63%. This decline can be attributed to the mass case closures as \na result of California Assembly Bill (AB) 1686, which resulted in the termination of Foster Care referrals to Solano DCSS and \nthe subsequent closure of any existing Foster Care cases within the department\u2019s caseload. \n\u2022 \nDuring the same 12-month period, Solano DCSS: \n\uf0a7 \nCollected $29,202,016 through income withholding orders in cooperation with employers which accounted for almost \n73% of our overall collections and $2,254,384 of past due child support owed through federal and State tax intercepts. \n\uf0a7 \nAttended 1,422 court hearings to establish, modify, or enforce child support on behalf of children and families. \n\uf0a7 \nReviewed 1,563 requests to review court ordered child support obligations due to a change in circumstances. Of those \nrequests, 426, or 27% resulted in a modification of the monthly child support obligations that better reflected the parents\u2019 \nability to pay.",

On January \n10, 2025, CA DCSS issued its FY2025/26 funding allocation to all LCSAs. This funding allocation is insufficient to cover all known \ncosts. \nTo bridge the deficit between the department\u2019s allocation and projected expenditures, Solano DCSS will utilize the State\u2019s Budget \nReallocation Request process to leverage a drawdown of $513,635 in federal and State funding. The department will continue to \nutilize this process in upcoming years, provided that funds remain available through CA DCSS. The CA DCSS has forecasted, for \nthe next few fiscal years, a surplus of unspent funding, which is not utilized by other LCSAs, that will remain available for \nunderfunded counties. Once those funds have been exhausted, the department will utilize its Fund Balance to leverage a \ndrawdown in federal monies as part of the Federal Financial Participation (FFP) Match Program. However, for future fiscal years, \nit is recommended that the County General Fund provide bridge funding to continue the drawdown of these federal monies, if \nneeded. \nDETAIL BY REVENUE\nAND APPROPRIATION\nPERCENT\nFUNCTIONAL AREA\nCHANGE\nREVENUES\n OPERATIONS\n12,589,163\n \n13,950,392\n \n12,992,646\n \n(957,746)\n \n (6.9%)\nTOTAL REVENUES\n12,589,163\n \n13,950,392\n \n12,992,646\n \n(957,746)\n \n (6.9%)\nAPPROPRIATIONS\n CHILD SUPPORT CASE MANAGEMENT\n8,447,875\n \n9,246,244\n \n8,979,750\n \n(266,494)\n \n (2.9%)\n ADMINISTRATION\n571,772\n \n604,676\n \n675,517\n \n70,841\n \n11.7%\n CLERICAL SUPPORT SERVICES\n1,488,379\n \n1,797,738\n \n1,500,884\n \n(296,854)\n \n (16.5%)\n OPERATIONS\n2,074,730\n \n2,566,575\n \n1,836,495\n \n(730,080)\n \n (28.4%)\nTOTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n12,582,756\n \n14,215,233\n \n12,992,646\n \n(1,222,587)\n \n (8.6%)\nCHANGE IN FUND BALANCE\n CHILD SUPPORT CASE MANAGEMENT\n8,447,875\n \n9,246,244\n \n8,979,750\n \n(266,494)\n \n (2.9%)\n ADMINISTRATION\n571,772\n \n604,676\n \n675,517\n \n70,841\n \n11.7%\n CLERICAL SUPPORT SERVICES\n1,488,379\n \n1,797,738\n \n1,500,884\n \n(296,854)\n \n (16.5%)\n OPERATIONS\n(10,514,433)\n \n(11,383,817)\n \n(11,156,151)\n \n227,666\n \n (2.0%)\nCHANGE IN FUND BALANCE\n(6,407)\n \n264,841\n \n0\n \n(264,841)\n \n (100.0%)\nSTAFFING\nCHILD SUPPORT CASE MGMT\n65\n60\n57\n(3)\n(5.0%)\nADMINISTRATION\n2\n2\n2\n0\n0.0%\nCLERICAL SUPPORT SERVICES\n12\n11\n10\n(1)\n(9.1%)\nTOTAL STAFFING\n79\n73\n69\n(4)\n (5.5%)\nACTUAL\nBUDGET\nRECOMMENDED\nRECOMMENDED\n2024/25\nFROM\n2023/24\nADOPTED\n2025/26\nADOPTED TO\n\n2480 \u2013 Fund 369-Department of Child Support Services \n Functional Area Summary \nLiane Peck, Director of Department of Child Support Services \nJudicial \n \n \n \nH-4 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nPrimary Costs \nThe Recommended Budget represents a decrease of $1,222,587 or 8.6% in appropriations primarily due to: \n\u2022 \nSalaries and Employee Benefits reflect a net decrease of $385,239 due to deletion of 4.0 FTE vacant positions, partially offset \nby increases in retirement and health benefit costs. \n\u2022 \nServices and Supplies reflect a decrease of $543,813 primarily due to reductions in Legal Services, Advertising, and Lease \nBuilding Expense. \n\u2022 \nOther Charges reflect a decrease of $184,021 primarily due to the decrease in Countywide Administrative Overhead costs. \n\u2022 \nOther Financing Uses reflect a decrease of $109,511 due to the full redemption of the Pension Obligation Bonds (POBs). \nFixed Assets \nNone. \nDEPARTMENT COMMENTS \nFunding challenges continue to impact the child support program; however, it should be noted that even without additional funding, \nincreased costs and increased workloads due to legislative and policy changes, Solano DCSS continues to meet the needs of its \ncustomers and performs very well compared to other LCSAs in California with an overall ranking of 12 out of 58 counties.

The District Attorney carries out these responsibilities through various bureaus, \nlocated in the cities of Fairfield and Vallejo, including homicide, family protection, general felony, misdemeanors, Driving Under \nthe Influence (DUI) prosecutions, auto theft prosecutions, fraud prosecutions, prison crimes, and civil prosecutions. The Office \nalso provides county law enforcement agencies with forensic laboratory services and evidence collection and storage in support \nof criminal offense prosecution. Additionally, the District Attorney may sponsor, supervise, or participate in any project or program \nto improve the administration of justice. Through these efforts, the District Attorney's Office pursues its mission to seek and do \njustice for victims of crime. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nChallenges: \nOver the past several years, the District Attorney\u2019s Office has had a substantial increase in prosecutorial responsibilities including, \nbut not limited to, changes in post-conviction laws, court mandates, collaborative courts, restorative justice programs, outreach in \nthe community, and the addition of the Solano Major Crimes Task Force.

A week prior, members of the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) Oakland Field Office arrested \nfour individuals who were subsequently charged with federal firearm violations. These two investigations provide examples \nof the level of commitment by all of our local, State, and federal law enforcement partners to reduce violent crime in our \ncommunity. Our office, together with our law enforcement partners, will continue to prioritize dismantling and disrupting the \ncriminal activity of those trafficking humans, guns, and drugs. The Solano County District Attorney\u2019s Office will also continue \nto partner with the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of California to reduce gun violence in our community by prosecuting \nthese crimes to the fullest extent of the law. \n\u2022 \nImpaired Driving and Fentanyl Awareness Program: On June 6, 2024, the Solano County District Attorney\u2019s Office was \nawarded a $145,198 grant from the California Highway Patrol Cannabis Tax Fund Grant Program to create an educational \ncampaign directed toward high school students that increased knowledge and awareness of the inherent dangerousness of \nthe consumption of controlled substances which are contributing factors to impaired driving. Since the fall of 2024, the District \nAttorney\u2019s Office in collaboration with the Solano County Office of Education, Solano County Public Health, local law \nenforcement, and first responders have been presenting to local high school students about the dangers of driving while \nimpaired. These school assemblies include a powerful video about a high school student\u2019s firsthand account of what the \nlasting impacts are when losing friends in a fatal DUI crash, and how one error in judgment can have a lasting impact on the \nrest of your life. The assemblies also discuss the dangers of ingesting a controlled substance laced with fentanyl, and how \nthese drugs impair one from driving safely and lead to death. \n\u2022 \nSolano County Major Crimes Task Force: On November 12, 2020, the District Attorney announced the establishment of the \nSolano County Major Crimes Task Force (SCMCTF) one of the first of its kind in the State. The task force is responsible for \nconducting independent investigations into the use of deadly force by law enforcement officers in the county. The SCMCTF, \nwhich is comprised of experienced investigators from our local police agencies, works under the supervision of the District \nAttorney\u2019s Office. The task force continues to prove to be successful in that every investigation is conducted independently, \nthoroughly, in a timely fashion, and most importantly instills public trust in the outcome. Since its formation, there has been a \nsignificant decrease in officer involved fatalities. In 2024, SCMCTF responded to six events, one of which was an officer \ninvolved fatality. The SCMCTF also responds and assists law enforcement agencies in the investigations of major crimes \noccurring throughout Solano County. \n\u2022 \nWorkers\u2019 Compensation Fraud Unit: On April 5, 2024 a defendant pled guilty to six counts of Insurance Fraud and Grand \nTheft after a joint investigation with the California Department of Insurance, the Solano County District Attorney\u2019s Office, and \nthe Employment Development Department (EDD) revealed the defendant illegally underreported payroll by nearly $1 million \nto avoid paying workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums and taxes. The defendant was placed on felony probation, \nordered to serve 120 days (ASP), pay over $725,000 in restitution, a $50,000 fine to the California Department of Insurance, \nand surrender their contractor\u2019s license. \n\u2022 \nVictim Witness Assistance Program: The District Attorney\u2019s Office continues to operate its Victim Witness Assistance Program \nas part of its commitment to obtaining justice for crime victims. The program\u2019s staff, including a Victim Witness Program \nCoordinator, nine victim witness assistants, and two office assistant II positions assigned to both the Fairfield and Vallejo \noffices, provided victims of crime with direct services. For 2024, the program received 2,673 new cases, equal to 2023. The \nprogram provided support for 1,327 victims of domestic violence in 2024, a decrease of 8% from 2023. The program supported \n188 families of homicide victims, 83 adult victims of sexual assault, and 190 child victims of sexual assault and their families. \nThe program also assisted 1,228 victims in completing Victim Compensation Board claims, accompanied 476 victims to court, \nand assisted 171 victims with restitution claims. \nWORKLOAD INDICATORS \nThe workload at the District Attorney\u2019s Office has significantly increased in recent years due to the recent changes in criminal law \nin California. This includes Senate Bill (SB) 1437 (Felony Murder), Assembly Bill (AB) 1950, (Shortening of Probation), Proposition \n57 (Early Release from Prison), AB 1793 (Marijuana), AB 2542 (Racial Justice Act), AB 965 (Franklin Hearings), AB 600 (Judicial \ninitiated resentencing on any case), AB 1310 (Resentencing Gun Enhancements), and AB 1540 (Resentencing Prison Prior \nEnhancements).",

Abrams, District Attorney \n \nJudicial \n \n \n \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nH-15 \nFUNCTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES \nThis special revenue fund provides a funding source for the investigation, detection, and prosecution of crime, including drug use \nand gang activity, consumer protection, and environmental protection. \nThis budget is under the direction of the District Attorney (DA) and is divided into three principal budgetary divisions: \nDivision 4101 \u2013 DA Narcotic Asset Forfeiture Fund - Pursuant to the California Health and Safety Code \u00a711489, the sources of \nrevenue for this fund are cash and proceeds from the sale of seized property that has been used or obtained through illegal \nnarcotics trafficking, including vehicles, boats, and real estate. Asset forfeiture proceeds provide a source of funding for general \ninvestigation, training, and all aspects of the prosecution of crimes. \nDivision 4102 \u2013 DA Consumer Protection Fund \u2013 Pursuant to the provisions of the California Business and Professions Code, \ncourt-ordered fines and forfeitures accrue to this fund for the support of general investigation and all aspects of the prosecution of \nconsumer protection cases. This division reimburses the DA\u2019s operating budget (Fund 900 - BU 6500). \nDivision 4103 \u2013 DA Environmental Protection Fund \u2013 California Health and Safety Code \u00a725192 provides that a percentage of \nfines levied against the commission of environmental offenses be provided to the prosecuting agency bringing the action. The \nDistrict Attorney has established this division of the DA Special Revenue Fund to provide a funding source in support of general \ninvestigation and all aspects of the investigation and prosecution of environmental crimes. \nThe Fund Balance in this Fund is restricted by funding source for each of the applicable divisions above. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents an increase of $590,000 or 195.4% in revenues and a decrease of $271,504 or 13.6% in \nappropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget, resulting in a decrease in Fund Balance of $838,370. Budgeted \nrevenues and appropriations may vary depending on the status and outcomes of various cases. Any unused Fund Balance is \nappropriated in Contingencies (BU 9116). \nDivision 4101: \nThe District Attorney\u2019s Narcotic Asset Forfeiture Fund Recommended Budget of $2,000 in revenue reflects no change when \ncompared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. Revenues are primarily related to Forfeitures and Penalties income. The division\u2019s \nbudget includes $100,558 in appropriations which reflects a decrease of $145 or 0.1% when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted \nBudgeted due to a decrease in Countywide Administrative Overhead costs. The current appropriations include a rebudget of \n$100,000 in Operating Transfers-Out to the District Attorney\u2019s operating budget (BU 6500) to partially offset the new case \nmanagement software system. \nDivision 4102: \nThe District Attorney\u2019s Consumer Protection Fund Recommended Budget funds the Consumer Protection Unit of the District \nAttorney\u2019s operating budget (BU 6500) via an Operating Transfers-Out. Revenues of $890,000 represent an increase of $590,000 \nwhen compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget due to an increase in Forfeiture and Penalties income. The division\u2019s budget \nincludes $1,629,812 in appropriations which reflects a decrease of $271,359 or 14.3% when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted \nBudget primarily due to a reduction in staffing costs for the Consumer Protection Division based on the classification of staff \nassigned and the anticipated workload. \nDivision 4103: \nThe District Attorney\u2019s Environmental Protection Fund does not budget any revenue or appropriations until funds are actually \nreceived. \nFixed Assets \nNone. \nSee related BU 9116 \u2013 Fund 233 Contingencies (refer to Contingency section of the Budget).\n\n4100 \u2013 Fund 233-DA Special Revenue Fund \nSummary of Other Administered Budgets \nKrishna A.

In its 1963 decision, \nGideon v. Wainright, the United States Supreme Court found \na Constitutional, Sixth Amendment right to counsel for \ncriminal defendants unable to afford their own attorney. \nSubsequent United States Supreme Court cases extended \nthis right to persons in danger of losing a substantial right. \nBudget Summary: \nFY2024/25 Midyear Projection: \n21,008,701 \nFY2025/26 Recommended: \n21,633,303 \nCounty General Fund Contribution: \n19,771,558 \nPercent County General Fund Supported: \n91.4% \nTotal Employees (FTEs): \n74 \nFUNCTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES \nLike most California counties, Solano County fulfills its Constitutional mandate by means of a Public Defender\u2019s Office, established \nin 1968, pursuant to Government Code (GC) \u00a727700-27712 and Penal Code (PC) \u00a7987.2. \nThe Public Defender maintains offices in Fairfield and Vallejo where Superior Court proceedings are held. The scope of \nrepresentation includes all phases of criminal litigation from arraignment through some post-conviction proceedings. As \nappropriate to each client, legal issues are researched, investigations are conducted, written motions are prepared, and oral \npresentations are made in all court hearings, including court and jury trials. \nMost of the Public Defender\u2019s clients are adults and juveniles accused of criminal offenses ranging from misdemeanors to serious \nfelonies, including capital offenses. The Civil Unit provides competent legal representation to individuals threatened with \nconservatorship proceedings. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nChallenges: \n\u2022 \nIn November 2024, the voters approved Proposition 36, which rolled back some reforms that had been enacted with \nProposition 47 in 2014. Proposition 36 created a new \u201ctreatment mandated felony\u201d for people who are charged with simple \npossession of controlled substance who have prior convictions and created a felony theft charge for petty theft with prior \nconvictions, as well as some other changes. In the first two months of this law, the Public Defender has been appointed on \n25 cases that are felonies rather than misdemeanors, which will result in significant increases in felony caseloads if the trend \ncontinues. As felonies, these cases require additional resources. Clients charged with felony drug possession who are",

The \nlaw requires that the Public Defender\u2019s Office investigate and pursue this option for all clients who may be eligible for diversion \nin order to provide effective assistance of counsel. While this assists clients with mental illness access treatment, which results \nin improved outcomes and reduced incarceration, there are significantly increased costs in obtaining psychological \nassessments and treatment plans, and an increased workload on the department\u2019s social workers. Costs related to these \nevaluations continue to increase, and the overwhelming majority of our clients must be evaluated for eligibility for the program. \n\u2022 \nSeveral recent sentencing laws have increased the information judges are required to consider at sentencing. For clients \nunder the age of 26 who are facing lengthy sentences, the Public Defender\u2019s Office is required to complete a mitigation \ninvestigation which increases the workload for investigators, lawyers, and clerical staff and requires the retention of experts \nin different fields. New rules applicable to sentencing in almost all felony cases requires that the department present evidence, \nwhen appropriate, that a defendant has experienced trauma or was the victim of intimate partner violence or human trafficking. \nThese requirements add to the tasks that must be completed by attorneys to meet their professional obligations, increase the \nworkload on social workers and investigators, and may also require psychological evaluations to be presented in court. \nAccomplishments: \n\u2022 \nThe Public Defender\u2019s Office provided representation in over 8,000 new and ongoing cases to almost 6,000 clients. 41% of \nmisdemeanor cases were dismissed outright, while another 16% were dismissed for successful completion of diversion. For \nfelony cases, 24% were dismissed outright. \n\u2022 \nThe department\u2019s robust record clearing program continues to help community members remove barriers to employment and \neducational opportunities due to past arrests and convictions. The department held its second Clean Slate record clearing \nevent in January 2025 in Fairfield, serving hundreds of community members. Staff continues to collaborate with Health and \nSocial Services and other local organizations to inform the community of the availability of services to expunge criminal \nrecords. \n\u2022 \nIn FY2025/26, the Public Defender\u2019s Office will continue to utilize grant funds from the Board of State and Community \nCorrections (BSCC) to increase access to post-conviction litigation. Grant funds have enabled the department to expand \nlitigation on behalf of individuals serving lengthy sentences who may be eligible for parole including Youthful Offender Parole \nHearings (Franklin/Miller) and felony murder resentencing (PC \u00a71172.6). Grant funds are providing additional staffing as well \nas paying costs for expert evaluations for these clients. \n\u2022 \nBody-worn and dash video cameras continue to require a significant consumption of time, and department attorneys are \nrequired to review anything disclosed prior to litigation or plea bargain in order to provide effective assistance of counsel. \nThese files also significantly impact the department\u2019s volume of data storage. In March 2025, the department began a pilot \nproject with video transcription and analysis service that is anticipated to reduce the time spent reviewing videos and reduce \ntranscription costs. \n\u2022 \nThe Public Defender\u2019s Office collaborated with Behavioral Health, County Counsel and the Solano County Courts to kick-off \nthe start of Care Court on December 1, 2024. Care Court is a program which provides voluntary services to individuals with \nsevere mental illness, with the goal of reducing homelessness and incarceration. \nWORKLOAD INDICATORS \n\u2022 \nIn 2024, the Public Defender\u2019s Office opened approximately 2,400 felony cases, 3,800 misdemeanor cases, 148 juvenile \npetitions, and 340 civil and other client cases. \n\u2022 \nThe resources required to provide effective assistance of counsel, even in misdemeanor cases, continues to increase. New \nlaws and court opinions require staff to complete a full mitigation work up in an increasing array of case types. Staff is required \nto investigate and advocate for mental health diversion in any case where it could be applicable, which requires substantial \nrecord collection, a psychological evaluation and report, as well as litigation. Adding to the workload, the prosecution continues \nto file the most serious charges and enhancements available, including filing second and third strikes.",

These cases \nrequire significantly more resources than other serious felony cases. \n \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents an increase of $145,577 or 0.7% in both revenues and appropriations when compared to \nthe FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. As a result, the General Fund Contribution increased by $120,738 or 0.6% when compared to \nthe FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. \nPrimary Funding Sources \nThe primary funding source for the department is General Fund Contribution, which comprises $19,771,558 or 91.4% of the \nRecommended Budget. \nThe Recommended Budget includes a net increase of $145,577 in revenues primarily due to the following: \n\u2022 \nIntergovernmental Revenues reflect an increase of $24,839 due to the anticipated increase in 2011 Public Safety Realignment \n(AB 109) funding due to increases in Salaries and Employee Benefits and a contract for Partners for Justice approved by the \nCommunity Corrections Partnership in May of 2024, offset by a decrease in Public Defense Pilot Project Grant funds from the \nBoard of State and Community Corrections (BSCC) as this grant is ending in FY2024/25. \n\u2022 \nOther Financing Sources of $19,771,558 represent the General Fund Contribution, an increase of $120,738 when compared \nto the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. The increase in the General Fund Contribution is primarily the result of increases in \nSalaries and Employee Benefits due to increases in wages, retirement, and health benefit costs, and increases in \npsychological and other professional services costs to provide collaborative defense services to pretrial clients. The Public \nDefender focuses on services and programs that are constitutionally mandated and seeks grant funding when available to \noffset the General Fund Contribution. However, there are a limited number of grants and other sources of funding for the \ndepartment to enhance its revenues for criminal defense work. \nPrimary Costs \nThe Recommended Budget includes a $145,577 net increase in appropriations primarily due to the following: \n\u2022 \nSalaries and Employee Benefits reflect an increase of $70,144 primarily due to increases in wages, retirement, and health \nbenefit costs, partially offset by reductions in extra help expenses. \nDETAIL BY REVENUE\nAND APPROPRIATION\nPERCENT\nFUNCTIONAL AREA\nCHANGE\nREVENUES\n PUBLIC DEFENDER\n18,640,791\n \n21,487,726\n \n21,633,303\n \n145,577\n \n0.7%\nTOTAL REVENUES\n18,640,791\n \n21,487,726\n \n21,633,303\n \n145,577\n \n0.7%\nAPPROPRIATIONS\n PUBLIC DEFENDER\n18,640,791\n \n21,487,726\n \n21,633,303\n \n145,577\n \n0.7%\nTOTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n18,640,791\n \n21,487,726\n \n21,633,303\n \n145,577\n \n0.7%\nNET CHANGE\n0\n \n0\n0\n0\n0.0%\nSTAFFING\nPUBLIC DEFENDER\n74\n74\n74\n0\n0.0%\nTOTAL STAFFING\n74\n74\n74\n0\n0.0%\nACTUAL\nBUDGET\nRECOMMENDED\nRECOMMENDED\n2024/25\nFROM\n2023/24\nADOPTED\n2025/26\nADOPTED TO\n\n6530 \u2013 Fund 900-Public Defender \nFunctional Area Summary \nElena D\u2019Agustino, Public Defender \nJudicial \n \n \n \nH-20 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \n\u2022 \nServices and Supplies reflect an increase of $374,793 primarily due to increases in psychological and other professional \nservices costs to provide collaborative defense services to pretrial clients. \n\u2022 \nOther Charges reflect a decrease of $128,368 primarily due to a decrease in Countywide Administrative Overhead costs. \n\u2022 \nOther Financing Uses reflect a decrease of $174,112 due to the full redemption of the Pension Obligation Bonds (POBs). \nContracts \nThe FY2025/26 Recommended Budget includes the following significant contracts: \n\u2022 \n$243,183 to provide collaborative defense services to pretrial clients funded with 2011 Public Safety Realignment (AB 109) \nfunding. \n\u2022 \n$108,991 for an annual software maintenance/license with Journal Technologies, the department\u2019s case management \nsystem.

In 2021, the Legislature passed Assembly Bill (AB) 625, directing California to undertake a public \ndefender workload study. The expected completion date is early 2025 and it is anticipated that it will include non-attorney core \nstaff and other issues left unaddressed by the national study. \nIn 2023, SB 43 was enacted which expands the eligibility for Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (LPS) conservatorship to include those \nwho suffer from substance use disorder, and those who are unable to provide for their own safety or medical care. Solano County \ndelayed implementation until January 2026. It is anticipated that there will be a significant increase in the number of people who \nare eligible for conservatorship due to this expansion. While the Alternate Defender currently only represents a small number of \nclients facing conservatorship, that is likely to increase with the expansion in the law.",

Most counties in California, including Solano \nCounty, fulfill their Constitutional duty by establishment of a Public Defender\u2019s Office. In certain cases, however, the Public \nDefender may have a conflict of interest, commonly occurring when a single case involves multiple indigent defendants, or some \nprior relationship exists with a party to the case. In these instances, the Public Defender must decline appointment, and the \nCounty\u2019s obligation to provide counsel are met by the Alternate Public Defender\u2019s Office, unless a conflict of interest exists there \nas well. If both the Public Defender and the Alternate Defender are unable to provide representation, the case is assigned to \nprivate counsel under Other Public Defense (BU 6730). \nThe Office of the Alternate Public Defender maintains separate offices in Fairfield and Vallejo, where the Superior Courts hear \ncases. The Office provides representation at all phases of criminal litigation, from arraignment through post-conviction \nproceedings. As appropriate to each client, legal issues are researched, investigations are conducted, written motions are \nprepared, and oral presentations are made in all court hearings, including court and jury trials. \nSince approximately June 2000, the Alternate Public Defender\u2019s Office has operated under the administrative authority of the \nPublic Defender. The Office\u2019s duties and characteristics are similar to those of the main Public Defender\u2019s Office (BU 6530). \nHowever, pursuant to California Penal Code (PC) \u00a7987.2 and the case law, the Alternate Public Defender\u2019s Office is organized as \na separate division of the Public Defender\u2019s Office, under the direct supervision of a Chief Deputy Public Defender. \nThe majority of the clients represented by the department are adults and juveniles accused of criminal offenses. The offenses \nrange from traffic misdemeanors to serious felonies, including capital offenses. A small portion of the cases involve advising \nwitnesses, whose testimony could be incriminating, and conservatorships. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nChallenges: \n\u2022 \nStarting in 2019, PC \u00a71001.36 significantly expanded the availability of pre-trial diversion to defendants charged with either \nfelonies or misdemeanors who suffer from a mental disorder that was a significant factor in the commission of the crime. The \nlaw requires that the Alternate Public Defender\u2019s Office investigate and pursue this option for all clients who may be eligible \nfor diversion in order to provide effective assistance of counsel. While this assists clients with mental illness access treatment, \nwhich results in improved outcomes and reduced incarceration, there are significantly increased costs in obtaining \npsychological assessments and treatment plans, and an increased workload on the department\u2019s social workers. Costs \nrelated to these evaluations continue to increase, and the overwhelming majority of our clients must be evaluated for eligibility \nfor the program. \n\u2022 \nIn November 2024, the voters approved Proposition 36, which rolled back some reforms that had been enacted with \nProposition 47 in 2014. Proposition 36 created a new \u201ctreatment mandated felony\u201d for people who are charged with simple \npossession of controlled substance who have prior convictions and created a felony theft charge for petty theft with prior \nconvictions, as well as some other changes. In the first two months of this law, the Alternate Public Defender has been \nappointed on several cases that are felonies rather than misdemeanors because of the change in the law. As felonies, these \ncases require additional resources. Clients charged with felony drug possession who are diagnosed with a substance use \ndisorder are eligible for Mental Health Diversion, and, as discussed below, require a psychological evaluation.",

For clients \nunder the age of 26 who are facing lengthy sentences, the Alternate Public Defender\u2019s Office is required to complete a \nmitigation investigation which increases the workload for investigators, lawyers, and clerical staff and requires the retention \nof experts in different fields. New rules applicable to sentencing in almost all felony cases requires that the department present \nevidence, when appropriate, that a defendant has experienced trauma or was the victim of intimate partner violence or human \ntrafficking. These requirements add to the tasks that must be completed by attorneys to meet their professional obligations, \nincrease the workload on social workers and investigators, and may also require psychological evaluations to be presented \nin court. \nAccomplishments: \n\u2022 \nThe Alternate Public Defender\u2019s Office provided representation in approximately 1,900 new and ongoing cases to almost \n1,300 clients. \n\u2022 \nThe department\u2019s robust record clearing program continues to help community members remove barriers to employment and \neducational opportunities due to past arrests and convictions. \n\u2022 \nIn FY2025/26, the Alternate Public Defender\u2019s Office will continue to utilize grant funds from the Board of State and Community \nCorrections (BSCC) to increase access to post-conviction litigation. These grant funds have enabled the department to \nexpand litigation on behalf of individuals serving lengthy sentences who may be eligible for parole including Youthful Offender \nParole Hearings (Franklin/Miller) and felony murder resentencing (PC \u00a71172.6). Grant funds are providing additional staffing \nas well as paying costs for expert evaluations for these clients. \n\u2022 \nBody-worn and dash video cameras continue to require a significant consumption of time, and department attorneys are \nrequired to review anything disclosed prior to litigation or plea bargain in order to provide effective assistance of counsel. \nThese files also significantly impact the department\u2019s volume of data storage. In March 2025, the department, began a pilot \nproject with a video transcription and analysis service that is expected to reduce the time spent reviewing videos and reduce \ntranscription costs. \nWORKLOAD INDICATORS \n\u2022 \nIn 2024, the Alternate Public Defender\u2019s Office opened approximately 600 felony cases, 700 misdemeanor cases, 7 civil and \nother cases, and 41 juvenile petitions. \n\u2022 \nThe resources required to provide effective assistance of counsel, even in misdemeanor cases, continues to increase. New \nlaws and court opinions require staff to complete a full mitigation work up in an increasing array of case types. As discussed \nabove, staff is required to investigate and advocate for mental health diversion in any case where it could be applicable, which \nrequires substantial record collection, a psychological evaluation and report, as well as litigation. Adding to the workload, the \nprosecution continues to file the most serious charges and enhancements available, including filing second and third strikes. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents increases of $23,565 or 0.3% in revenues and appropriations when compared to the \nFY2024/25 Adopted Budget. As a result, the General Fund Contribution increased by $25,144 or 0.4% when compared to the \nFY2024/25 Adopted Budget. \nPrimary Funding Sources \nThe primary funding source for the department is the General Fund Contribution, which comprises $6,694,061 or 97.3% of the \nRecommended Budget. \nThe Recommended Budget includes an increase of $23,565 in revenues primarily due to the following: \n\u2022 \nOther Financing Sources of $6,694,061 represents the General Fund Contribution, an increase of $25,144 when compared \nto the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. The increase in the General Fund Contribution is primarily the result of an increase in \nSalaries and Employee Benefits due to increases in retirement and health benefit costs. The Alternate Public Defender \nfocuses on services and programs that are constitutionally mandated and seeks grant funding when available to offset General \nFund Contribution. However, there are very few grants and other sources of funding for the department to enhance its \nrevenues for criminal defense work.",

The expected completion date is early 2025 and it is anticipated that it will include non-attorney core \nstaff and other issues left unaddressed by the national study. \nIn 2023, SB 43 was enacted which expands the eligibility for Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (LPS) conservatorship to include those \nwho suffer from substance use disorder, and those who are unable to provide for their own safety or medical care. Solano County \ndelayed implementation until January 2026. It is anticipated that there will be a significant increase in the number of people who \nare eligible for conservatorship due to this expansion.

Both campuses and auxiliary buildings need infrastructure renewal. The Sheriff\u2019s Office is currently \nworking with the County Administrator and the Department of General Services on efforts to plan, fund, schedule, and \nefficiently complete the necessary work. Currently, there are several projects in the planning stages, getting ready to \ncommence or currently in progress such as repair/replacement of the facilities elevator cars, tower controls, security \nelectronics project, booking renovation, jail bed modifications, sewer pipe replacement, campus hardening and flood \nmitigation, Behavioral Health Unit implementation, and the impacts from the new courthouse. \n\u2022 \nPublic Records Act Requests: Senate Bill (SB) 16 became effective January 1, 2022, which amended California Penal Code \n\u00a7832.7 broadening the categories of disclosable documents. While the number of such incidents involving Sheriff\u2019s Office \npersonnel is limited, multiple documents involving hundreds of pages have needed to be reviewed. Additionally, many hours \nof body camera images, recorded statements, and video evidence need to be examined and redacted prior to release all \nunder strict timelines. \n\u2022 \nEmergency Management: Emergency Operations Center (EOC) activations have significantly increased with more frequent \nflooding, wildfires, and Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS). During activations, public safety and health are paramount and \nthe routine work of the Office of Emergency Services (OES) staff, including grants management, training and exercises, \nvolunteer recruitment, and public outreach activities are greatly curtailed. Activations for PSPS are not considered \nemergencies and therefore have no reimbursements for overtime or other expenditures during the events. As disasters and \nevents continue to occur more frequently, OES is faced with challenges in maintaining adequate staffing levels to respond. \nAccomplishments: \n\u2022 \nSheriff\u2019s Recruitment Site: The Sheriff\u2019s Office launched a recruitment website, joinsolanosheriff.com in the summer of 2024 \nto assist with recruiting hard to fill positions such as Correctional Officer, Dispatcher, and Sheriff\u2019s Security Officer. The site \nlinks applicants directly to the Solano County Careers website.

Direct inquiries are made \nthrough the website, downloaded to a google drive database, and then distributed to members of the Sheriff\u2019s recruitment \nteam to make personal contact and answer questions about the hiring, background process, and the positions. Since July of \n2024, the Sheriff\u2019s Office has received 285 inquiries through the website. \n\u2022 \nChild Sexual Abuse Material Investigations: The Investigations Bureau has dedicated one deputy investigator for the pilot \nproject known as Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM).

The software system automatically captures in-service \ntraining attendance, range qualifications, and reduces paperwork and the potential for clerical errors. \nWORKLOAD INDICATORS \nAdministration \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \nTotal annual civil papers received for processing \n4,165 \n5,320 \n7,201 \n8,986 \n9,530 \nNumber of restraining orders processed \n1,487 \n1,847 \n2,426 \n2,524 \n2,838 \nNumber of warrants processed \n6,054 \n7,543 \n7,139 \n6,084 \n5,736 \n \nCompliance \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \nNumber of background investigations processed \n466 \n453 \n400 \n426 \n666 \nNumber of CCW permit applications (new/renewal/modified) \n1,943 \n1,700 \n1,967 \n2,079 \n1,666 \nNumber of public records requests processed \n921 \n1,379 \n1,770 \n1,994 \n2,370 \nNumber of training hours provided to staff \n27,000 \n24,120 \n29,134 \n32,309 \n32,019 \n \nCustody \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \nNumber of bookings \n10,509 \n9,968 \n9,444 \n9,748 \n10,875 \n Felonies \n5,030 \n4,945 \n4,583 \n4,796 \n4,785 \n Misdemeanors \n4,890 \n4,509 \n4,356 \n4,679 \n5,416 \n Other \n588 \n514 \n504 \n571 \n673 \nAverage daily population \n540 \n630 \n550 \n501 \n503 \nAverage stay (days) \n18.8 \n21.9 \n21.3 \n18.7 \n17.4 \n \nEmergency Services \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \nNumber of Emergency Operations Center Activations \n3 \n4 \n0 \n1 \n7 \nNumber of search and rescue operations \n14 \n20 \n15 \n8 \n18 \nNumber of calls for service - Dispatch \n101,728 \n94,833 \n91,278 \n88,850 \n88,837 \n \n\nFunctional Area Summary \n6550 \u2013 Fund 900-Sheriff/Coroner \n \nThomas A.

Ferrara, Sheriff/Coroner \nPublic Protection \n \n \n \nH-32 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \n \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents increases of $1,542,894 or 0.9% in both revenues and appropriations when compared to \nthe FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. As a result, the General Fund Contribution is increased by $5,333,253 or 6.0%. The increase is \nlargely attributed to loss of revenue from inmate housing/institutional care and the increasing gap between Trial Court Security \nfunding and the cost to provide mandated court bailiff and building security services. Salaries and Employee Benefits, countywide \nadministrative overhead, contracted inmate medical and mental health care services, central data processing charges, \nreplacement of computers, and one-time purchases of fixed assets including the replacement of the dispatch audio logger and \nStanton Correctional Facility tablets also contributed to the increases. \nThe primary funding source for the Sheriff\u2019s Office is General Fund Contribution of $94,942,607 or 56.9% of the Recommended \nBudget. The primary source of non-county revenue is Proposition 172 Public Safety Tax at $37,394,915 or 22.4% of total revenues. \nThe Public Safety Tax is tied to State sales tax revenue and is directly impacted by the State\u2019s economy. The Sheriff\u2019s Office is \nprojecting a decrease of $347,507 or 0.9% in Proposition 172 revenues when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget as the \nDETAIL BY REVENUE\nAND APPROPRIATION\nPERCENT\nFUNCTIONAL AREA\nCHANGE\nREVENUES\n ADMINISTRATION\n117,358,413\n \n127,742,254\n \n133,056,158\n \n5,313,904\n \n4.2%\n CUSTODY\n13,409,187\n \n16,517,751\n \n13,624,398\n \n(2,893,353)\n \n (17.5%)\n FIELD OPERATIONS\n17,299,135\n \n19,174,644\n \n18,395,209\n \n(779,435)\n \n (4.1%)\n EMERGENCY SERVICES\n1,086,160\n \n1,255,460\n \n1,153,712\n \n(101,748)\n \n (8.1%)\n COMPLIANCE\n444,672\n \n503,761\n \n507,287\n \n3,526\n \n0.7%\nTOTAL REVENUES\n149,597,567\n \n165,193,870\n \n166,736,764\n \n1,542,894\n \n0.9%\nAPPROPRIATIONS\n ADMINISTRATION\n30,055,760\n \n37,549,556\n \n37,783,247\n \n233,691\n \n0.6%\n CUSTODY\n65,081,239\n \n70,127,308\n \n70,781,605\n \n654,297\n \n0.9%\n FIELD OPERATIONS\n43,180,333\n \n45,495,887\n \n45,756,866\n \n260,979\n \n0.6%\n EMERGENCY SERVICES\n5,594,646\n \n6,102,824\n \n6,490,104\n \n387,280\n \n6.3%\n COMPLIANCE\n5,982,058\n \n5,918,295\n \n5,924,942\n \n6,647\n \n0.1%\nTOTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n149,894,036\n \n165,193,870\n \n166,736,764\n \n1,542,894\n \n0.9%\nNET COUNTY COST\n ADMINISTRATION\n(87,302,653)\n \n(90,192,698)\n \n(95,272,911)\n \n(5,080,213)\n \n5.6%\n CUSTODY\n51,672,052\n \n53,609,557\n \n57,157,207\n \n3,547,650\n \n6.6%\n FIELD OPERATIONS\n25,881,198\n \n26,321,243\n \n27,361,657\n \n1,040,414\n \n4.0%\n EMERGENCY SERVICES\n4,508,486\n \n4,847,364\n \n5,336,392\n \n489,028\n \n10.1%\n COMPLIANCE\n5,537,386\n \n5,414,534\n \n5,417,655\n \n3,121\n \n0.1%\nNET COUNTY COST\n296,469\n \n0\n0\n \n0\n \n0.0%\nSTAFFING\n ADMINISTRATION\n54.0\n \n54.0\n \n54.0\n \n0.0\n0.00%\n CUSTODY\n283.0\n \n285.5\n \n286.5\n \n1.0\n0.35%\n FIELD OPERATIONS\n174.0\n \n172.0\n \n172.0\n \n0.0\n0.00%\n EMERGENCY SERVICES\n29.0\n \n29.0\n \n29.0\n \n0.0\n0.00%\n COMPLIANCE\n14.0\n \n14.5\n \n14.5\n \n0.0\n0.00%\nTOTAL STAFFING\n554.0\n \n555.0\n \n556.0\n \n1.0\n \n0.18%\nACTUAL\nBUDGET\nRECOMMENDED\nRECOMMENDED\n2024/25\nFROM\n2023/24\nADOPTED\n2025/26\nADOPTED TO\n\nFunctional Area Summary \n6550 \u2013 Fund 900-Sheriff/Coroner \n \nThomas A. Ferrara, Sheriff/Coroner \n \nPublic Protection \n \n \n \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nH-33 \nState\u2019s economy has been impacted by inflationary measures, a statewide decline in retail sales, and a potential recession. Other \nprincipal funding sources include State payments for providing court security services, $7,768,098 or 4.7% of total revenues; and \nState allocations under the various programs within 2011 Public Safety Realignment of $10,640,270 or 6.4% of total revenues. \nAdministration and Support (BU 6551): \nThe primary programs for Administration and Support are Administrative Services and Employee Services. Other programs include \nRecords and Warrants, Civil, and Technology Services. \nThe Recommended Budget for Administration is $133,056,158 in revenues and $37,783,247 in appropriations. This represents \nan increase of $5,313,904 or 4.2% in revenues and an increase of $233,691 or 0.6% in appropriations when compared to the \nFY2024/25 Adopted Budget. The increase in revenue is primarily due to an increase in General Fund Contribution. Other \nsignificant increases are for civil processing fee revenue, State Supplemental Law Enforcement Services Fund (SLESF) \nreimbursement, and an increase in Transfers-In from the Civil Processing Fund (BU 4110). These increases are somewhat offset \nby a decrease in Proposition 172 revenues. Administration\u2019s Recommended Budget assumes civil processing fee revenue and \nTransfers-In from the Sheriff\u2019s Other Administered Funds will continue to offset costs of the Civil program; Proposition 172 \nrevenues will continue to fund law enforcement services; and the Inmate Welfare Fund and Animal Care and Control will continue \nto offset administrative fiscal, payroll and personnel costs. The net increase in expenditures is primarily due to an increase in \nCountywide Administrative Overhead charges. Other significant cost increases are for liability insurance, purchase of refresh \ncomputers, central data processing charges, and software subscriptions and licenses. Additionally, the Recommended Budget \nincludes $394,763 in Fixed Assets for the replacement of officer tablets at the Stanton Correctional Facility and Network Attached \nStorage (NAS) Video storage for the Claybank Detention Facility and for cloud-hosting of the Sheriff\u2019s Civil Processing software. \nThe Administration and Support Recommended Budget funds 54.0 FTE positions. \nCustody (BU 6552): \nThe primary programs for Custody are the Justice Center Detention Facility, the Claybank Detention Facility, and the Stanton \nCorrectional Facility. Other programs include Alternative to Custody, Inmate Health Care, Inmate Programming, and the Rourk \nVocational Training Center. \nThe Recommended Budget for Custody is $13,624,398 in revenues and $70,781,605 in appropriations. This represents a \ndecrease of $2,893,353 or 17.5% in revenues and an increase of $654,297 or 0.9% in appropriations when compared to the \nFY2024/25 Adopted Budget. The decrease in revenues is primarily due to a reduction in institutional care revenue as fewer outside \ninmates are anticipated to be housed in Solano jail facilities. The decrease is somewhat offset by increases to State Funding from \n2011 Public Safety Realignment, Jail-Based Competency Treatment (JBCT), Medical County Inmate Program (MCIP), and Jail \nAccess Fees. Custody\u2019s Recommended Budget assumes SLESF monies will continue to fund maintenance projects and \nequipment; State funding for JBCT and Early Access and Stabilization Services (EASS) will continue to fund mental health services \nto return offenders to competency to stand trial; 2011 Public Safety Realignment funding, State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, \nand State booking allocation will continue to support Custody operations and inmate programming; and Inmate Welfare Funds will \ncontinue to fund vocational training and supplies. Custody\u2019s Recommended Budget further assumes County Mental Health \nServices Act (MHSA) monies from Health and Social Services will continue to fund re-entry services for mentally ill offenders. The \nnet increase in expenditures is primarily due to increases in Salaries and Employee Benefits which reflect an increase of \n$1,128,974 or 2.3% primarily due to increases in wages, health insurance, and retirement costs. Other significant cost increases \nare for contracted inmate medical, mental health, dental services, JBCT services, and case management re-entry services. \nThe 2011 Public Safety Realignment funding for Community Corrections is $7,244,492 for FY2025/26. These funds help to offset \nsome of the costs of housing Public Safety Realignment (AB 109) inmates, such as staff Salaries and Employee Benefits, \noperational costs including medical and food costs, and programming costs. \nThe Custody Recommended Budget funds 286.5 FTE positions. \nField Operations (BU 6553): \nThe primary programs for Field Operations are Patrol, Court Services, and Security Services. Other programs include Marine \nPatrol, Community Policing, Transportation, Investigations, Forensic Identification Services, the Sheriff\u2019s Emergency Response \nTeam, the Armory, and the Coroner\u2019s Office.",

Ferrara, Sheriff/Coroner \nPublic Protection \n \n \n \nH-34 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nThe Recommended Budget for Field Operations is $18,395,209 in revenues and $45,756,866 in appropriations. This represents \na decrease of $779,435 or 4.1% in revenues and an increase of $260,979 or 0.6% in appropriations when compared to the \nFY2024/25 Adopted Budget. The decrease in revenues is primarily due to a reduction in available Trial Court Security funds. Other \nsignificant decreases are due to a reduction in Boating Financial Aid augmentation funds and a decrease in Transfers-In from the \nAutomated Identification Fund (BU 4050). These decreases are somewhat offset by increases from contracted law enforcement \nservices, Cal-MMET funding, and contracted security services. The Recommended Budget assumes State Trial Court Security \nmonies will continue to support court security activities; Cal-MMET funding will continue to support narcotics investigations; \nTransfers-In from the Sheriff\u2019s Other Administered Funds will continue to offset costs of the Cal-ID program; and 2011 Public \nSafety Realignment funding will continue to support the Sheriff\u2019s Enforcement Team. The increase in expenditures is primarily due \nincreases in Salaries and Employee Benefits which reflect an increase of $1,671,675 or 4.4% primarily due to increases in wages, \nhealth insurance, and retirement costs. Additionally, the Recommended Budget includes $21,808 in Fixed Assets primarily related \nto the purchase a replacement laboratory commercial refrigerator and a computer image response kit used in investigations, \nfunded with SLESF funds. \nThe 2011 Public Safety Realignment program budget allocation for Community Corrections is $1,451,588 for FY2025/26. This \nRealignment funding funds Salaries and Employee Benefit costs for 5.0 FTE positions, including: 1.0 FTE Sergeant-Sheriff and \n4.0 FTE Deputy Sheriffs, as well as operating costs for these positions, such as County fleet services, fuel, communications, and \noffice expenses. \nThe Field Operations Recommended Budget funds 172.0 FTE positions. \nEmergency Services (BU 6554): \nThe primary programs for Emergency Services are the Office of Emergency Services (OES) and Dispatch. Other volunteer \nprograms within OES include Search and Rescue, the Dive Team, and the Cadet program. \nThe Recommended Budget for Emergency Services is $1,153,712 in revenues and $6,490,104 in appropriations. This represents \na decrease of $101,748 or 8.1% in revenues and an increase of $387,280 or 6.3% in appropriations when compared to the \nFY2024/25 Adopted Budget. The decrease in revenues is primarily due to reduced reimbursements for grant-funded extra-help \npositions and the absence of one-time monies from SLESF. These decreases are somewhat offset by higher contracted dispatch \nservices charges to local law enforcement and fire agencies. Emergency Services\u2019 Recommended Budget assumes all other \nagencies will continue to use dispatch services at or near the same number of calls as in prior years; and Emergency Management \nPerformance Grants and Homeland Security Grants will continue to offset certain extra-help costs and support limited OES \nadministrative activities. The net increase in expenditures is primarily due to increased Salaries and Employee Benefits which \nreflect an increase of $214,323 or 4.4% primarily due to increases in wages, health insurance, and retirement costs. Other \nsignificant cost increases include maintenance/service contracts and consulting services. Additionally, the Recommended Budget \nincludes $92,284 in Fixed Assets for the replacement of the dispatch audio logger. \nThe Emergency Services Recommended Budget funds 29.0 FTE positions. \nCompliance (BU 6555): \nThe primary programs for Compliance are Professional Standards and Training. Other programs include Internal Investigations, \nCarry Concealed Weapons (CCW) Permitting Services, and the Corrections Academy. \nThe Recommended Budget for Compliance is $507,287 in revenues and $5,924,942 in appropriations. These represent an \nincrease of $3,526 or 0.7% in revenues and an increase of $6,647 or 0.1% in appropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 \nAdopted Budget. The increase in revenues is primarily due to an anticipated increase in CCW permit revenue and an increase in \nregistration fee revenue from the annual Solano-hosted CCW Conference. These increases are somewhat offset by decreases to \nState funding allocations and reimbursements for mandated and other training. Compliance\u2019s Recommended Budget assumes \nState funding from Standards and Training for Corrections and Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) will continue to \npartially offset training costs for correctional and sworn staff. The net increase in expenditures is primarily due to increased Salaries \nand Employee Benefits which reflect an increase of $30,098 or 0.7% primarily due to increases in wages and retirement costs \nand increased extra-help hours. Other significant cost increases are for contracted pre-employment background investigative \nservices and to rent event space for the annual CCW conference.",

The Recommended \nBudget reflects appropriations for inmate food service, inmate medical, mental health and dental services, and inmate supplies. \nPublic Safety Realignment for Community Corrections (AB 109) \nThe 2024 calendar year indicates little change as the combined ADP of AB 109 inmates at the three detention facilities was 104, \na slight decrease from 114 inmates for the 2023 calendar year. Using the 2024 ADP and the FY2025/26 Board-approved daily \nbed rate of $503.00, approximately $19.1 million of costs may be attributed to Public Safety Realignment inmates. Although the \nSheriff\u2019s Office anticipates receiving $7.2 million of the County\u2019s share of Public Safety Realignment for custody operations, the \nrevenue is insufficient to cover the full program costs.

Approximately \n$400,000 in vocational training supplies and instructor expenses are being purchased through the Inmate Welfare Fund. \nHousing Justice-Involved Persons \nSince Sonoma County removed inmates from Solano County facilities on October 15, 2024, the Sheriff\u2019s Office has pursued \nopportunities to enter into agreements with other counties to house adult justice-involved persons. The Sheriff\u2019s Office is currently \nin negotiations with two separate counties for housing of inmates at the Solano County facilities; therefore, the Recommended \nBudget includes $616,850 in anticipated institutional care revenues. \nCourt Security \nUnder the 2011 Public Safety Realignment, counties receive Trial Court Security funds to offset the costs of providing mandated \nbailiff services and building perimeter security services to the State Courts within their jurisdiction. Although the Sheriff\u2019s Office \nanticipates receiving $7.8 million in Trial Court Security funds, the revenue is insufficient to fully cover program costs. General \nFund dollars make up the difference. \nRio Vista Law Enforcement Services \nThe Sheriff\u2019s Office provides contracted law enforcement services to the City of Rio Vista. The Recommended Budget includes \n$3,530,323 in appropriations and offsetting revenue to fund continued law enforcement services through June 30, 2026. \nTraining \nCorrections staff are required to complete 24 hours of training annually to comply with the Board of State and Community \nCorrections (BSCC) Standards and Training for Corrections mandate. The Deputies and other sworn staff as well as Dispatchers \nare required to complete 24 hours of training every two years to comply with the California POST mandate. Additional training of \nsoft skills and general topics are offered to all department employees including professional and administrative staff. The \nRecommended Budget includes $1,262,667 in appropriations for training and related expenses. These appropriations are partially \noffset by State revenues and other funding sources. \nCorrections Academy \nAccording to the standards set by BSCC, newly recruited correctional staff are required to undergo Core training within the first \nyear of their employment. The Core training program is an intensive five-week course (with a minimum of 176 hours) covering \nessential modules and topics necessary for performing job duties effectively. The Solano County Corrections Academy has been \nvery successful, and the Sheriff\u2019s Office anticipates offering two Corrections Academy sessions in FY2025/26. Each session can \naccommodate up to 20 participants and the Sheriff\u2019s Office will continue to accept applicants sponsored by other agencies \nwhenever space permits. The Recommended Budget includes $45,636 in appropriations to cover instructor time and operational \nexpenses to include providing each participant with program clothing and supplies. These appropriations are partially offset by \nstate revenues and Academy registration fees from outside agencies. Moreover, the cost for the Corrections Academy is lower \nthan the cost to send staff to another academy. \nCitizens\u2019 Academy \nThe Sheriff\u2019s Citizens\u2019 Academy is for adult residents of Solano County who wish to learn more about the Sheriff\u2019s Office and its \nfunction. The Academy hosts up to 30 participants for approximately ten weeks, offering weekly sessions for instruction and \nobservation opportunities. The Citizens\u2019 Academy helps the Sheriff\u2019s Office to connect and strengthen relationships and \ncommunicate accountability and transparency. The Citizens\u2019 Academy has been well received, with some participants returning \nto volunteer their time. The Recommended Budget includes $4,100 in appropriations to provide participants with polo shirts, mugs, \npadfolios, class photos, and refreshments. \nYouth Academy \nThe Sheriff\u2019s Youth Academy is designed for pre-teens and teens (ages 10 to 15 years old). The one-week summer camp hosts \nup to 35 participants. Participants will learn about the Sheriff\u2019s Office and its function through instruction, demonstrations, and \ngames. The Youth Academy helps the Sheriff\u2019s Office connect and build relationships with young individuals in the community. It",

Ferrara, Sheriff/Coroner \n \nPublic Protection \n \n \n \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nH-39 \nOn December 10, 2024, the Board approved the following position change: \n\u2022 \nAdded 1.0 Project Manager, Limited-Term to assist with coordination and implementation of CalAIM PATH-JI requirements \nincluding collecting, monitoring, and reporting on California Department of Health Care Services measures. \nOn March 11, 2025, as part of the Midyear Financial Report the Board approved the following position changes: \n\u2022 \nDeleted 1.0 FTE Laundry Coordinator. \n\u2022 \nAdded 1.0 FTE Building Trades Mechanic to assist with building and equipment maintenance at the jail facilities and the Roark \nVocational Training Center. \n\u2022 \nExtended 1.0 FTE Mental Health Specialist II, Limited-Term to June 30, 2026. \n\u2022 \nExtended 1.0 FTE Custody Sergeant, Limited-Term to June 30, 2026. \nThere are no position allocation changes included in the FY2025/26 Recommended Budget. \nSTAFFING TREND \n \nPENDING ISSUES AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS \nCalAIM \nCalifornia Advancing and Innovating Medi-Cal (CalAIM) is a far-reaching, multi-year plan to transform California\u2019s Medi-Cal \nprogram and enable it to work more seamlessly with other social services. Led by the California Department of Health Care \nServices (DHCS), the goal of CalAIM is to improve outcomes for the millions of Californians covered by Medi-Cal, including those \nwith the most complex needs such as those transitioning from jail or prison back to the community who also have complex physical \nor behavioral health needs. The Sheriff\u2019s Office and Health and Social Services (H&SS) will partner to implement services at least \n90 days pre-release so that medical and behavioral health services are identified, and individuals are connected into these services \nupon re-entry. The Sheriff\u2019s Office developed and submitted an implementation plan and budget to the DHCS which was approved \nby DHCS and affirmed by the Board of Supervisors. The implementation plan leans heavily on technology to transfer and share \ndata over information systems. All counties are required to have fully implemented their plans and are ready for the October 1, \n2026 start date. The State has provided funding for this endeavor; however, once implemented, ongoing costs may require an \nincrease in General Fund contribution. \n\n6550 \u2013 Fund 900-Sheriff/Coroner \nFunctional Area Summary \nThomas A. Ferrara, Sheriff/Coroner \nPublic Protection \n \n \n \nH-40 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nNational Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) Accreditation \nNCCHC is a third-party, objective assessment and is the organization that writes the standard for correctional health care. \nAccreditation is based on the NCCHC Standards for Health Services, which come in separate manuals for jails, prisons, and \njuvenile detention and confinement facilities. Accreditation covers compliance with standards in the following general areas: \ngovernance and administration, safety, personnel and training, health care services and support, inmate care and treatment, \nhealth promotion, special needs and services, health records, and medical\u2013legal issues. Although currently not a State \nrequirement, accreditation is desirable as it demonstrates jail operations are following medical and mental health best practices, \nthereby reducing and/or preventing certain lawsuits. The Sheriff\u2019s Office submitted the initial NCCHC application in February of \n2024, which is pending approval. Once the application is approved, NCCHC will complete a site survey and provide additional \nrequirements to meet accreditation. It is anticipated accreditation would be complete by the end of 2026. \nBehavioral Health Unit \nToday\u2019s inmates are more prone to have mental illness and/or behavioral health issues. These inmates need a specialized or \nhigher level of care than inmates housed in general population. The Sheriff\u2019s Office is working on opening a Behavioral Health \nUnit (BHU) at the Justice Center Detention Facility to house and support inmates who may have a mental health condition, \npsychiatric diagnosis and/or those who exhibit behavioral patterns that hinder their ability to meet their basic needs independently \nor program within the general population. The BHU would incorporate a Step Up / Step Down (SU/SD) approach which would \nprovide varying levels of support based on an individual\u2019s needs and also include a designation for inmates committed to the \nDepartment of State Hospitals under Penal Code \u00a71370 in the Jail Based Competency Program (JBCT). The Sheriff\u2019s Office \nintends to return to the Board of Supervisors in early July to present the proposal. \nLaw Enforcement Services to Cities \nCurrently, the Sheriff\u2019s Office provides contracted law enforcement services to the City of Rio Vista. Over the last two years, the \nCity of Vallejo has experienced significant officer vacancies and, together with financial troubles, has asked the Sheriff\u2019s Office for \nassistance. The Sheriff\u2019s Office has provided limited support; however, the City is requesting dedicated temporary assistance until \nthey can hire adequate staffing. Options and associated costs have been explored and a terms sheet was provided to the City of \nVallejo in December of 2024. The Sheriff requested Board authorization to move forward with contract negotiations on May 6, \n2025. The Sheriff\u2019s Office plans on returning to the Board with a proposed contract no later than June 24, 2025 with a twelve-\nmonth service contract beginning January 2026. The potential need for contracted law enforcement services may continue to arise \nas other cities within Solano County are experiencing staffing shortages combined with lower operating revenues.",

Ferrara, Sheriff/Coroner \n \nPublic Protection \n \n \n \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nH-43 \nFUNCTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES \nUnder authority of Government Code (GC) \u00a726720 et seq., the Sheriff collects certain fees related to services provided through \nthe department\u2019s Civil Bureau (i.e., service of process, etc.). The specific code sections cited below provide for portions of fees \ncollected to be deposited into a special fund to be used for specified purposes. \nRecommended Budget revenues are driven by GC \u00a726731 (Portion of Civil Fees Collected) and GC \u00a726746 (Debtor Processing \nAssessment Fee): \n\u2022 \nGC \u00a726731 \u2013 $22 of any fee collected by the Sheriff\u2019s Civil Division is deposited into a special fund. Ninety-five percent (95%) \nof revenue in this special fund supplements costs for the implementation, maintenance and purchase of auxiliary equipment \nand furnishings for automated systems or other non-automated operational equipment and furnishings necessary for the \nSheriff\u2019s Civil Division. The remaining five percent (5%) of revenue in the special fund supplements expenses of the Sheriff\u2019s \nCivil Division in administering the funds. \n\u2022 \nGC \u00a726746 \u2013 A $15 processing fee is assessed for certain specified disbursements. Monies collected and deposited pursuant \nto this section supplement the cost for civil process operations. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents an increase of $20,379 or 12.5% in revenues and an increase of $107,685 or 94.3% in \nappropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget, resulting in a decrease in Fund Balance of $38,720. The \nincrease in revenues is primarily due to an increase in interest income and civil assessments. The increase in expenditures reflect \nan increase in Operating Transfers-Out of $221,934 to the Sheriff\u2019s operating budget (Fund 900 - BU 6550) to offset costs within \nthe Civil Program. No County General Fund dollars are included in this budget. \nFixed Assets \nNone. \nSee related Budget Unit 9117 \u2013 Fund 241 Contingencies (refer to Contingencies section of the Budget). \nDEPARTMENT COMMENTS \nAutomation, Equipment and Furnishings \nRevenue from GC \u00a726731 is limited in how funds can be expended with ninety-five percent (95%) restricted for the implementation, \nmaintenance, and purchase of auxiliary equipment and furnishings for automated systems or other non-automated operational \nequipment and furnishings. These funds are not available for operations. The Recommended Budget includes $182,163 in \nrestricted funds as an Operating Transfers-Out to the Sheriff\u2019s operating budget (Fund 900 \u2013 BU 6550) to cover expenses related \nto the implementation of a Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Compliant cloud hosted environment for all licensed \nCountySuite software, as well as the maintenance and support of Civil\u2019s case management system and credit card processing \nservices. \nInterest Income \nFund 241 is projected to earn interest income of $40,612 in FY2025/26. Interest income is attributable to the carryforward balance \nof restricted funds and therefore may only be used for the implementation, maintenance, and purchase of auxiliary equipment and \nfurnishings for automated systems or other non-automated operational equipment and furnishings.",

Ferrara, Sheriff/Coroner \n \nPublic Protection \n \n \n \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nH-45 \nFUNCTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES \nThe Sheriff\u2019s Office, in its role as a law enforcement agency, arrests and assists other local law enforcement agencies with the \narrests of suspected drug dealers. Personal property associated with illegal drug activity is often seized by the arresting agencies, \ndeclared \u201cforfeited\u201d by a court order, and then sold. The Sheriff\u2019s Office\u2019s portion of any applicable sale proceeds is deposited in \na special revenue fund and expended to support programs in the Sheriff\u2019s operating budget for the investigation, detection, and \nprosecution of criminal activities, and to combat drug abuse and gang activity. \nHealth and Safety Code \u00a711489 authorizes the distribution of net sale proceeds from the sale of forfeited property seized from \nillegal drug activity. Sixty-five percent of the net sale proceeds are distributed to the agencies that participated in the seizure, on \na proportionate contribution basis, with 15% of the 65% distributed into a special fund administered by the County District Attorney \nfor the sole purpose of funding programs designed to combat drug abuse and divert gang activity, and shall, wherever possible, \ninvolve educators, parents, community-based organizations, local businesses, and uniformed law enforcement officers. Further \ndistributions include 24% to the State of California General Fund, and 10% to the County District Attorney for reimbursement of \nthe costs of publication and agreed upon deposition costs. The remaining 1% is distributed to the State Asset Forfeiture Distribution \nFund for the Environmental Enforcement and Training Account. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents a decrease of $18,478 or 43.2% in revenues and an increase of $31,382 or 156.6% in \nappropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget, resulting in a decrease in Fund Balance of $27,156. The \ndecrease in revenues is primarily due to a decrease in Countywide Administrative Overhead. The increase in appropriations \nreflects an increase in Operating Transfers-Out totaling $51,416 to the Sheriff\u2019s operating budget (Fund 900 \u2013 BU 6550) to support \nthe Narcotics Canine Program. No County General Fund dollars are included in this budget. \nFixed Assets \nNone. \nSee related Budget Unit 9118 \u2013 Fund 253 Contingencies (refer to Contingencies section of the Budget). \nDEPARTMENT COMMENTS \nBudget Requirements \nThe U.S. Department of Justice budgetary guidelines state that revenues should not be budgeted before they are received. The \nRecommended Budget assumes Fund Balance can continue to fund the Sheriff\u2019s canine program. \nInterest Income \nFund 253 is projected to earn interest income of $8,391 in FY2025/26. Interest income is attributable to the carryforward balance \nof local asset forfeitures and therefore may be used for the Sheriff\u2019s canine program or other allowable expenditures. \n \nDETAIL BY REVENUE\nCATEGORY AND\nAPPROPRIATION CATEGORY\n2023/24\n ACTUAL\n2024/25 \nADOPTED\nBUDGET\n2025/26\nRECOMMENDED\nFROM\nADOPTED TO\nRECOMMENDED\nPERCENT\nCHANGE\nREVENUES\nREVENUE FROM USE OF MONEY/PROP\n8,672\n4,082\n8,391\n4,309\n105.6%\nCHARGES FOR SERVICES\n22,749\n38,656\n15,869\n(22,787)\n(58.9%)\nTOTAL REVENUES\n31,421\n42,738\n24,260\n(18,478)\n(43.2%)\nAPPROPRIATIONS\nOTHER FINANCING USES\n32,941\n20,034\n51,416\n31,382\n156.6%\nTOTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n32,941\n20,034\n51,416\n31,382\n156.6%\nCHANGE IN FUND BALANCE\n1,520\n(22,704)\n27,156\n49,860\n(219.6%)",

CalAIM PATH-JI funding is available in three funding streams: Round 1, Round 2, and Round 3. \n\u2022 \nPATH JI Round 1: $125,000 to support collaborative planning with county departments and other enrollment implementation \npartners to identify processes, protocols, and IT modifications necessary to support implementation of pre-release enrolment \nand suspension processes. \n\u2022 \nPATH JI Round 2: $1,173,174 to support the implementation processes, protocols, and IT system modifications identified \nduring the Round 1 planning phase. \n\u2022 \nPATH JI Round 3: $3,500,000 to support both planning and implementation of justice-involved re-entry services developed \nin Round 2, including investments in capacity and IT systems needed to effectuate Medi-Cal justice-involved re-entry services. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nChallenges: \n\u2022 \nCorrectional facilities are mandated to go-live with pre-release services no sooner than April 1, 2024, and no later than \nSeptember 30, 2026. California statute (Assembly Bill [AB] 133 Chapter 143, Statutes of 2021) mandated all counties begin \nimplementation of pre-release Medi-Cal enrollment processes by January 1, 2023. Existing referral processes between the \nSheriff\u2019s Office, Probation Department, and the Department of Health and Social Services (H&SS) met the initial \nimplementation requirement; however, the existing process does not meet the full criteria for pre-release Medi-Cal enrollment \nas mandated by AB 133. The Sheriff\u2019s Office will continue to work with the Department of Information Technology (DoIT), \nH&SS, and Probation to develop and implement data-sharing and procedures to help ensure justice-involved persons receive \nMedi-Cal coverage upon re-entry into the community. \nAccomplishments: \n\u2022 \nSolano County jail facilities are now compliant with State requirements for Medi-Cal enrollment in the jails and suspension \nand unsuspension of Medi-Cal services related to time in jail and release. \n\u2022 \nSolano County\u2019s CalAIM PATH-JI implementation plan for correctional facilities was approved by the DHCS. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents an increase of $1,169,975 or 161.0% in revenues and an increase of $1,208,877 or 175.7% \nin appropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. The net increases in revenue and expenditures are the result \nof the available carryforward balances of PATH-JI Rounds 2 and 3. No County General Fund dollars are included in this budget. \nThe appropriations support the Round 2 and Round 3 funded projects, which include: \n\u2022 \n$15,000 for Sheriff staff time associated (Round 2). \n\u2022 \n$25,000 for DoIT staff time associated (Round 2). \n\u2022 \n$67,500 for contracted inmate Medi-Cal assistance (Round 2). \n\u2022 \n$113,055 for contracted inmate Medi-Cal assistance (Round 3). \n\u2022 \n$180,000 to assist with the preparation of CalAIM PATH-JI implementation activities in accordance with the County\u2019s State-\napproved Implementation Plan (Round 3). \n\u2022 \n$202,575 for Sheriff staff time associated with (Round 3). \n\u2022 \n$293,740 for contracted services to assess incoming inmates for Medicated Assisted Treatment (MAT) needs (Round 3). \n\u2022 \n$1,000,000 for DoIT staff time associated (Round 3).",

No County General Fund \ndollars are included in this budget. \nThe appropriations support the 2024 SAVE grant funded projects which include: \n\u2022 \n$40,000 to remove and destroy vessels abandoned in Solano County waterways. \n\u2022 \n$20,000 to tow owner-surrendered vessels delivered or picked up by the Sheriff\u2019s Office to a local landfill for disposal and \ndestruction. \nContracts \nThe FY2025/26 Recommended Budget includes $40,000 for contracted vessel and/or partially submerged hazard removal and \ndisposal services. \nFixed Assets \nNone. \nDEPARTMENT COMMENTS \nGrant Status \nThe 2022 SAVE grant period ended September 30, 2024. The 2024 SAVE grant period ends September 30, 2026. The SAVE \nGrant Program requires a ten percent (10%) cash or in-kind match. The Sheriff\u2019s Office will continue to use existing appropriations \nfrom Sheriff Marine Patrol salaries to meet the match obligation. \n \nDETAIL BY REVENUE\nCATEGORY AND\nAPPROPRIATION CATEGORY\n2023/24\n ACTUAL\n2024/25 \nADOPTED\nBUDGET\n2025/26\nRECOMMENDED\nFROM\nADOPTED TO\nRECOMMENDED\nPERCENT\nCHANGE\nREVENUES\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL REV STATE\n12,893\n76,405\n60,000\n(16,405)\n(21.5%)\nTOTAL REVENUES\n12,893\n76,405\n60,000\n(16,405)\n(21.5%)\nAPPROPRIATIONS\nSERVICES AND SUPPLIES\n12,057\n76,405\n60,000\n(16,405)\n(21.5%)\nTOTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n12,057\n76,405\n60,000\n(16,405)\n(21.5%)\nNET COUNTY COST\n(836)\n0\n0\n0\n0.0%",

Ferrara, Sheriff/Coroner \nPublic Protection \n \n \n \n \nH-66 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nFUNCTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES \nThe Automated Identification budget was established to enable accounting for receipt of special revenues accruing from add-on \nvehicle registration fees approved by the Board of Supervisors and levied by the California Department of Motor Vehicles in \naccordance with State statutes. \nThe California Identification System (Cal-ID), as described in Penal Code \u00a711112.2, is the automated system maintained by the \nState Department of Justice for retaining fingerprint files and identifying latent fingerprints. This special revenue funds the conduct \nof automated fingerprint searches and fingerprint identification services for Solano County and the surrounding allied law \nenforcement agencies. \nEach of the special revenues within Fund 326 maintains its own dedicated Fund Balance. The specific special revenue streams \ncited below provide for fees collected to be deposited into a special fund to be used for specified purposes as designated by \nstatute. \n\u2022 \nAssessments. Under the authority of Government Code \u00a776102, the County Automated Fingerprint Identification Fund is \nintended to assist the County in the implementation of an Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS), including the \npurchase, lease, operation, personnel and related costs, maintenance, or replacement of automated fingerprint equipment. \nThe source of revenue is assessments on criminal and traffic fines collected by the Court as authorized by the County Board \nof Supervisors with Resolution 91-230. For every $10 of Court fines levied, an additional $7 in County assessments are levied, \nwith $0.50 of every $7 collected deposited into the Automated Fingerprint Identification Fund. The remaining $6.50 is divided \nup among the Criminal Justice Facility Temporary Construction Fund (Fund 263), the Courthouse Temporary Construction \nFund (Fund 264), Emergency Medical Services, and County Jail. \n\u2022 \nVehicle Registration Fees. Under the authority of California Vehicle Code \u00a79250.19, monies allocated shall be expended \nexclusively to enhance the capacity of local law enforcement to provide automated mobile and fixed location fingerprint \nidentification of individuals who may be involved in driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, vehicular manslaughter or \nany combination of those, other vehicle-related crimes, and other crimes committed while operating a motor vehicle. These \nmonies, upon recommendation from the local, seven-member Remote Access Network (RAN) Board, shall be used to \npurchase and operate equipment compatible with the Department of Justices\u2019 Cal-ID master plan and comply with Federal \nBureau of Investigation\u2019s electronic fingerprint transmission specifications. The source of revenue is a fee of $1 and $2 tied \nto the State vehicle registration fee for vehicles and commercial vehicles respectively as authorized by the County Board of \nSupervisors with Resolution 97-300. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents an increase of $8,016 or 1.6% in revenues and a decrease of $195,439 or 28.4% in \nappropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget, resulting in an increase to Fund Balance of $14,439. The \nincrease in revenues is primarily due to an increase in interest income. The decrease in expenditures is primarily due to a reduction \nin Other Financing Uses which includes an Operating Transfer-Out of $483,461 to the Sheriff\u2019s operating budget (Fund 900 - BU \n6550) to offset costs within the Cal-ID Program. No County General Fund dollars are included in this budget. \nFixed Assets \nNone. \nSee related Budget Unit 9125 \u2013 Fund 326 Contingencies (refer to Contingencies section of the Budget). \nDEPARTMENT COMMENTS \nThe budget is developed and approved by the local, seven-member Remote Access Network (RAN) Board as required by \nCalifornia Penal Code. The special revenue funds automated fingerprint searches and fingerprint identification services for Solano \nCounty and the surrounding allied law enforcement agencies. \nInterest Income \nThe Automated Identification budget, within Fund 326, is projected to earn interest income in FY2025/26 totaling $25,451. Interest \nincome is attributable to the carryforward balance of program funds and therefore will be used to support program operations.",

These \nadvancements offer significant benefits to law enforcement, such as the ability to: authenticate individuals remotely and avoid \nbringing individuals to a booking facility, identify dangerous individuals, identify individuals with outstanding arrest warrants, \nconfirm instances of mistaken identity, and view a driver\u2019s license photograph from the field. Solano County\u2019s current automated \nbiometric identification software was purchased in 2019 for approximately $750,000. The software is estimated to have a useful \nlife of seven to eight years. The cost for new cloud-based software is estimated to be over $1.7 million. \nOn April 8, 2025, the Board of Supervisors approved Resolution 2025-66 to increase the vehicle registration add-on fees from $1 \nto $2 for vehicles and from $2 to $4 for commercial vehicles.

Ferrara, Sheriff/Coroner \nPublic Protection \n \n \n \nH-68 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nFUNCTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES \nThe Vehicle Theft Investigation and Recovery budget was established to enable accounting for receipt of special revenues \naccruing from add-on vehicle registration fees approved by the Board of Supervisors and levied by the California Department of \nMotor Vehicles in accordance with State statutes that have restricted uses. Under the authority of Government Code \u00a776102 and \nCalifornia Vehicle Code \u00a79250.14, funds are accrued from a $2 State vehicle registration fee assessment for the enhancement of \nprograms to investigate and prosecute vehicle theft crimes. The Auto Theft Task Force is a proactive investigative unit consisting \nof undercover detectives from the Sheriff\u2019s Office and the California Highway Patrol. Detectives devote their full efforts to combat \nand reduce auto thefts. To achieve its goal of reducing vehicle theft in Solano County, the task force conducts surveillance in high \ntheft areas, seeks out possible \u201cchop-shop\u201d operations, and conducts probation and parole searches on persons previously \nconvicted of vehicle theft. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nAccomplishments: \nIn 2024, the task force recovered 146 stolen vehicles valued at $2,989,467 and made 39 vehicle theft arrests during the course \nof their investigations. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents a decrease of $20,174 or 3.9% in revenues and a decrease of $117,293 or 18.1% in \nappropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget, resulting in a decrease to Fund Balance of $28,768. The \ndecrease in revenues reflect a lower projected number of vehicles to be registered in the County and a decrease in interest income. \nThe decrease in expenditures is primarily due to a decrease in Salaries and Employee Benefits resulting from the department \nholding one Deputy Sheriff position in the Vehicle Theft Investigation and Recovery unit vacant beginning in January 2026 based \non available program funding. No County General Fund dollars are included in this budget. \nContracts \nThe FY2025/26 Recommended Budget includes $36,000 in Contributions to Other Agencies for vehicle theft investigation and \nrecovery assistance provided by the California Highway Patrol. \nFixed Assets \nNone. \nSee related Budget Unit 9125 \u2013 Fund 326 Contingencies (refer to Contingencies section of the Budget). \nDEPARTMENT COMMENTS \nShared Revenue \nRevenue from VC \u00a79250.14 registration add-on fees fund programs to investigate and prosecute vehicle theft crimes.

The bill would prohibit public agencies from sharing ALPR data with \nforeign jurisdictions or data brokers for immigration enforcement purposes and restricts the collection and retention of ALPR \ninformation to only cases related to criminal investigations. Additionally, the bill requires ALPR operators to develop and publicly \nshare detailed usage and privacy policies that outline the authorized purposes of ALPR systems, specify which employees can \naccess the data and for what reasons, and establish maximum data retention periods. The Solano County Sheriff\u2019s Vehicle Theft \nInvestigation and Recovery Program currently complies with these requirements, and only openly shares data with other agencies \nin the State of California or agencies outside of the State with a signed Memorandum of Understanding. Solano County does not \nstore any ALPR data and only access the data through a secured vendor operated site. \nFund balance carryover is expected to be mostly expended by the end of FY2025/26. Beginning in January 2026, only one Deputy \nSheriff will be assigned to the Vehicle Theft Investigation and Recovery Program. Major enforcement actions, sweeps and chop \nshop investigations will be completed on overtime to maintain program costs within the vehicle registration revenue received.

Ferrara, Sheriff/Coroner \nPublic Protection/Protection & Inspect \n \n \n \nH-70 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nDEPARTMENTAL PURPOSE \nAnimal Care Services is organized into two distinct functions: Animal Care and Animal Control. The Animal Care Division provides \ncountywide shelter services, which includes the seven cities of Benicia, Dixon, Fairfield, Rio Vista, Suisun City, Vacaville, and \nVallejo. The Animal Control Division provides services for the unincorporated areas of the County and for the Cities of Benicia, \nRio Vista, and Vallejo through service contracts. \nFUNCTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES \nAnimal Care \nUnder the authority of Chapter 4 of the Solano County Ordinances and Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the seven \ncities, Animal Care is responsible for providing animal care services through the following activities: care, shelter, and placement \nof stray and/or abandoned animals; spay and neutering of adoptable animals; and countywide dog licensing. In addition, Animal \nCare provides the public with low-cost spay/neuter and low-cost vaccination services. \nAnimal Control \nAnimal Control is responsible for providing animal control services and promoting responsible animal ownership through education \nand enforcement to the unincorporated areas and the Cities of Benicia, Rio Vista and Vallejo through patrols in areas of jurisdiction, \nenforcement of animal codes and regulations, and investigation of charges of animal abuse. Animal Control administers the \ncountywide rabies control program that is legally mandated by the California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 17 (Public Health), \nand CCR \u00a72606 (Rabies, Animal) and associated State regulations. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nChallenges: \n\u2022 \nStaffing: Retention of experienced office staff remains a constant challenge as most County office staff work Monday through \nFriday 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.; however, for public convenience, Animal Care office staff work Tuesday through Saturday 9:30 \na.m. to 6:30 p.m. Poor retention is often attributed to the difference in work schedules. Additionally, retention and hiring of \nexperienced registered veterinary technicians (RVT\u2019s) has been an ongoing challenge. Per the Business and Professions \nCode, only a licensed veterinarian or RVT can induce anesthesia; therefore, maintaining or increasing spay-neuter surgeries \nis hindered when there are RVT vacancies. Finally, a nationwide veterinarian shortage has made recruitment for a part-time \ncontract veterinarian increasingly difficult. A long-term shortage in the veterinarian position may result in backlogs for essential \nservices like spay/neuter surgeries and potentially longer stays for animals, increased disease risk, and higher costs for \nveterinary services. \n\u2022 \nVolunteer Program: Staff needs approximately 80 to 100 volunteers to help with adoption events, outreach opportunities, \nfundraising, animal transports, office assistance, clinic support, shelter upkeep, and with providing enrichment to the animals. \nAnimal Care has 61 volunteers, 20 of which are active volunteers. The animal care outreach and volunteer coordinator has \nbroad responsibilities that not only include fundraising, public relations, coordinating a variety of community outreach activities \nand events, but also recruiting, managing, and maintaining the Animal Care Volunteer and Foster Program. These vast duties \nlimit the time available for increasing and strengthening the volunteer program. The Sheriff\u2019s Office continues to search for \ndedicated volunteers to assist Animal Care Services. \n\u2022 \nPublic Spay-Neuter Services: Animal Care contracts with two part-time veterinarians. The workload for these part-time \nemployees includes balancing public spay-neuter surgeries, shelter surgeries, and the medical program. In 2024 there were \n2,639 shelter surgeries, a 39.8% increase compared to 2023, and 794 public surgeries, a 35.0% decrease compared to 2023. \nAnimal Care Services is recruiting for an additional part-time veterinarian to help keep up with the spay-neuter demand and \ncommunity requests to provide low-cost spay and neuter services. \nAccomplishments: \nThe Shelter live release rate continues to increase from 39% in 2011 to 78% in 2024. \n\u2022 \nLife Saving Measures: Animal Care has implemented several services and programs that have drastically reduced the \neuthanasia rate in the County. These efforts include the community cat program and the dedication and passion of the Animal \nCare Services Team to promote adoptions and live releases of all the animals entrusted in their care. This dedication has led",

As a result, the number of animals euthanized has dramatically declined from 6,013 in 2011 to 1,480 in 2024, a \n75.4% reduction. \n\u2022 \nAnimal Balance: A partnership with Animal Balance and the RSO Foundation resulted in 201 animals from Solano County \nspayed or neutered and vaccinated in a 3-day event held at Animal Care Services in October 2024. Animal Balance, an \norganization whose mission is to collaborate with communities in need to create sustainable and humane non-human animal \nmanagement programs to prevent suffering and ignite social change, partners with local animal care facilities and veterinarian \nclinics to provide high volume, high standard veterinarian medical teams for spay-neuter surgeries around the United States \nand in Ecuador. Animal Care was responsible for providing the facilities, equipment and medications necessary for the \nsurgeries, scheduling the surgeries with animal owners, providing local volunteers to assist with general (non-medical) clinic \nduties such as registration, cleaning, and animal transport. In addition to current Animal Care staff, a total of 15 volunteers \nfrom the community assisted in this 3-day event. \n\u2022 \nOffice Dog Program: In March 2024, Animal Care, in collaboration with Sheriff\u2019s Administration, reinstituted the Office Dog \nProgram with the intent of giving Animal Care\u2019s adoptable dogs the most exposure and best chance at finding their forever \nhomes. A Sheriff\u2019s Office volunteer picks up the Office Dog from Animal Care each week on Wednesday morning and walks \nthe dog through various locations including the County\u2019s Sheriff\u2019s Administration, Dispatch, Records & Warrants, Coroner\u2019s \nOffice, County Administrator\u2019s Office, County Counsel, District Attorney\u2019s Office, Probation, the Family Justice Center, \nForensic Lab, Health and Social Services Beck Campus, the Fairfield Police Department, and City of Fairfield Administration \nBuildings. In 2024, a total of 29 Office Dogs found new homes, many adopted by County employees. As of the first week of \nApril 2025, staff have found homes for 7 of the adoptable dogs housed at Animal Care. \n\u2022 \nCommunity Outreach & Education: Animal Care believes in working side by side with the community to provide education \nand resources. There are numerous offsite adoption events throughout the year that aids in helping pets find new homes and \neducating the public on Animal Care processes and lifesaving programs. The Sheriff\u2019s Office recognizes the need for \ncompassionate response to the unhoused members of our community. We have a team of dedicated employees from Animal \nCare and Control who are overseen by a deputy, who engage and provide pet food, vaccines, microchips, and spay-neuter \nservices to improve the quality of life for the pets and people who are unhoused. This Homeless Outreach Team also \ncollaborates with other agencies in the county to provide services for humans. \nWORKLOAD INDICATORS \nAnimal Care Services \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \nNumber of animals received for processing \n4,846 \n4,539 \n5,468 \n6,438 \n6,567 \nNumber of animals adopted \n820 \n1,060 \n999 \n1,068 \n1,472 \nNumber of animals returned to their owner \n942 \n520 \n685 \n632 \n940 \nNumber of animals rescued by nonprofits \n704 \n787 \n980 \n1,000 \n700 \nNumber of animals transferred to other shelters \n957 \n505 \n732 \n884 \n1,075 \nNumber of public clinic vaccinations \n31 \n387 \n354 \n488 \n752 \n \nAnimal Control Services \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \nNumber of call outs for animal bites \n810 \n692 \n739 \n658 \n900 \nNumber of animals quarantined \n771 \n574 \n600 \n772 \n762 \nNumber of animal abuse investigations conducted \n39 \n43 \n42 \n40 \n44",

Ferrara, Sheriff/Coroner \nPublic Protection/Protection & Inspect \n \n \n \nH-72 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents an increase of $500,216 or 10.5% in revenues and a decrease of $173,931 or 2.6% in \nappropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. As a result, the Net County Cost decreased by $674,147 or \n36.4%. The decrease is largely attributed to decreases in insurance costs, reduced contracted services costs resulting from a new \nvendor, and a reduction in Countywide Administrative Overhead costs. \nPrimary Funding Sources \nThe primary funding sources are Charges for Services and Intergovernmental Revenues which represent $5,165,793 or 98.2% of \ntotal revenues. Intergovernmental Revenues - Other of $3,798,498 reflect cost-recovery of prior year expenditures from the cities \nof Benicia, Dixon, Fairfield, Rio Vista, Suisun, Vacaville, and Vallejo in accordance with the prevailing Memorandum of \nUnderstanding. Charges for Services of $1,367,295 include City of Vallejo, Benicia and Rio Vista payments totaling $1,010,768 \n(19.2% of total revenue) for providing animal control services in their respective city limits, and fees charged to the public for \nservices such as spay-neuter procedures and dog licensing totaling $356,527 (6.8% of total revenues). \nAnimal Care (BU 2851): \nThe Recommended Budget for Animal Care represents an increase of $392,828 or 10.4% in revenues and a decrease of $209,109 \nor 4.0% in appropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. The increase in revenue is primarily due to an \nincrease in Intergovernmental Revenues related to a higher share-of-cost due from city partners. The annual payment is \nproportional and based on intake from the cities in the previous fiscal year. As city payments are billed a year in arrears, payments \nare anticipated to increase next fiscal year. It is anticipated that city payments will continue to support shelter operations. \nThe net decrease in expenditures is attributed to decreases in insurance and Countywide Administrative Overhead costs, offset \nby increases in Salaries and Employee Benefits due to increases in retirement and health benefit costs. Additional savings is \nprojected due to the transition from PetData to DocuPet for countywide animal licensing services. \nThe Animal Care Recommended Budget funds 24.0 FTE positions, including 1.0 FTE Animal Control Officer providing rabies \nservices under the Animal Care MOU with the cities. \nAnimal Control (BU 2852): \nThe Recommended Budget for Animal Control represents an increase of $107,388 or 11.1% in revenues and an increase of \n$35,178 or 2.7% in appropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. The increase in revenues is primarily due \nto an increase in Charges for Services to provide animal control services to the Cities of Vallejo, Benicia and Rio Vista. The \nRecommended Budget assumes services will be renewed for FY2025/26. \nThe increase in expenditures is primarily due to increases in Salaries and Employee Benefits resulting from increases in retirement \nand health benefit costs. \nThe Animal Control Recommended Budget funds 5.0 FTE positions. \nContracts \nThe FY2025/26 Recommended Budget includes the following significant contracts: \n\u2022 \n$503,111 for veterinary services. \nFixed Assets \nNone. \nDEPARTMENT COMMENTS \nCity Payments for Animal Shelter Services \nThe MOU requires the cities to make payments covering the prior year net shelter costs based on the percentages of animals \nreceived from each city to the total animals received by the shelter. Because the recovery method is in arrears, General Fund \nContribution fluctuates. \n\nSummary of Other Administered Budgets \n2850 \u2013 Fund 001-Animal Care Services \n \nThomas A. Ferrara, Sheriff/Coroner \n \nPublic Protection/Protection & Inspect \n \n \n \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nH-73 \nDonations \nDonations are received at the counter, through the mail, and online and reached $119,498 for the 2024 calendar year. As a \npractice, the Sheriff\u2019s Office does not budget for donations as they are deposited into a deferred revenue account. Donation \nrevenue is recognized only when funds are used to offset discounted costs for adoptions, spay/neuters, and microchipping, and \nfor occasional third-party surgical procedures. \n \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS \nNone. \nSUMMARY OF POSITION CHANGES \nThere are no changes in position allocation. \nPENDING ISSUES AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS \nSenate Bill 1233 (SB 1233) effective January 1, 2025, requires California veterinary medical schools to develop high-quality, high-\nvolume spay-neuter certification programs. These programs are available to veterinary students, licensed veterinarians, and \nregistered veterinary technicians aiming to increase the number of trained professionals in spay/neuter procedures. This legislation \nmay provide opportunities for Animal Care to better collaborate with veterinary schools, offering training programs for our staff, \nrecruitment and internship opportunities for students and ultimately to increase the capacity for spay/neuter services in Solano \nCounty. \nExisting law requires all public and private animal shelters to keep accurate records on each animal received, medically treated, \nor impounded, as specified. Assembly Bill 631 (AB 631) introduced on February 13, 2025, would require that animal shelters post \nspecific data on their websites, including the number of animals taken in, categorized by species, source of intake (e.g., stray, \nsurrendered, transferred), and outcomes for all animals (e.g., returned to owner, adopted, transferred, euthanized). The proposed \nlegislation would require the information be publicly accessible on the website, updated at least monthly, and remain available for \nat least five years. \nDETAIL BY REVENUE\nCATEGORY AND\nAPPROPRIATION CATEGORY\n2023/24\n ACTUAL\n2024/25 \nADOPTED\nBUDGET\n2025/26\nRECOMMENDED\nFROM\nADOPTED TO\nRECOMMENDED\nPERCENT\nCHANGE\nREVENUES\nLICENSES, PERMITS & FRANCHISE\n33,165\n33,733\n13,314\n(20,419)\n(60.5%)\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL REV STATE\n47,617\n73,734\n0\n(73,734)\n(100.0%)\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL REV OTHER\n2,738,360\n3,205,339\n3,798,498\n593,159\n18.5%\nCHARGES FOR SERVICES\n1,009,618\n1,312,616\n1,367,295\n54,679\n4.2%\nMISC REVENUE\n258,990\n133,495\n80,026\n(53,469)\n(40.1%)\nTOTAL REVENUES\n4,087,750\n4,758,917\n5,259,133\n500,216\n10.5%\nAPPROPRIATIONS\nSALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\n3,761,031\n4,467,504\n4,459,163\n(8,341)\n(0.2%)\nSERVICES AND SUPPLIES\n1,163,730\n1,453,109\n1,387,075\n(66,034)\n(4.5%)\nOTHER CHARGES\n539,489\n639,049\n571,104\n(67,945)\n(10.6%)\nLEASES\n4,810\n4,311\n5,450\n1,139\n26.4%\nOTHER FINANCING USES\n47,081\n46,176\n13,293\n(32,883)\n(71.2%)\nINTRA-FUND TRANSFERS\n4,066\n1,792\n1,925\n133\n7.4%\nTOTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n5,520,206\n6,611,941\n6,438,010\n(173,931)\n(2.6%)\nNET COUNTY COST\n1,432,456\n1,853,024\n1,178,877\n(674,147)\n(36.4%)\nSTAFFING\nANIMAL CARE\n20\n23\n24\n1\n0.0%\nANIMAL CONTROL\n6\n6\n5\n(1)\n-0.2%\nTOTAL STAFFING\n26\n29\n29\n0\n0.0%",

Farrah, Chief Probation Officer \n \nPublic Protection/Detention & Corrections \n \n \n \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nH-77 \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nChallenges: \n\u2022 \nThe department continues to experience hiring challenges amongst sworn and non-sworn classifications. The department \nvalues each employee and their essential role in probation work and understands the impact of being understaffed. Through \na strong, committed, and collaborative relationship with the Human Resources Department, the department filled many vacant \npositions; however, challenges remain in recruiting, hiring, and retaining staff in the Juvenile Correctional Counselor \nclassifications which require around the clock shift, weekend, and holiday schedules. The department remains committed to \nstaffing these critical positions. \n\u2022 \nHousing continues to be a barrier to many clients. The department continues to find the unhoused population as the most \ndifficult to supervise due to the inability to track and locate them. Stability is a significant factor in client success. Finding \navailable housing for female clients in south county and limited housing for 290 PC registrants, as well as the mental health \npopulation has continued to be a challenge. \n\u2022 \nTransportation is often a barrier for clients to receive needed services and it continues to be a significant issue both in terms \nof limited services available and the high cost of providing transportation services for clients. Some clients reside out of county \nand transportation is costly. \n\u2022 \nThe department continues to remain flexible and adjust to State legislation that often fails to consider Probation\u2019s role in the \njustice system, is frequently unfunded, and unaware of the unintended impacts at the local level. \nAccomplishments: \n\u2022 \nThe Professional Standards Unit has made a concentrated effort in filling the high number of vacancies in the \nDepartment. Staff participated in 13 career fairs in FY2023/24, showcasing the variety of job opportunities at Probation to \nhigh school, community college, and university students. Staff from various programs with a wide range of experience helped \nto deliver the message that the department embraces diversity and has a shared commitment to serving the community. To \nencourage and provide a path into probation work, the department also welcomed four college students into the department \ninternship program. \n\u2022 \nThe department continues to invest in staff development and professional growth by building internal training capacity. During \nFY2023/24, staff was invited to receive training certification in the Motivational Interviewing Network of Trainers (MINT). \nMotivational Interviewing is a foundational element of the department\u2019s communication and change approach with adult and \nyouth clients. Having an internal trainer and coach enhances staff\u2019s development of the skillset, eliminates the recurring cost \nof hiring external trainers, and saves the County and the department thousands of dollars each year. \n\u2022 \nBuilding on the in-house Motivational Interviewing capacity and increasing collaboration with County partners, the department \noffered an Introduction to Motivational Interviewing (MI) course to other county professionals who provide direct service to \nclients. The two-day course provides instruction to thirty learners and is designed to invigorate staff\u2019s understanding and use \nof MI and its impact on motivating positive behavior change, assisting other departments in meeting their own internal goals. \n\u2022 \nThe opportunities provided through the generosity of the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation continues to remain a vital part of \nassisting at risk youth of Solano County. This invaluable support helps youth successfully navigate not only probation but also \nassists in the preparation of positively transitioning out of the juvenile justice system into independence. This partnership \ncreated support for youth development, engagement, mentoring services, educational support, professional attire and barrier \nremoval services. The partnership ultimately allowed for the creation of culturally relevant experiences with a focus on building \nresiliency in the lives of youth in transition toward success. Barrier removal services were provided to over 50 youth, including \ntransportation support, housing support, basic clothing needs/shoes, self-care items, and food. \n\u2022 \nThe department established a contract with Seneca Family of Agencies to expand the array of in-house behavioral health \nsupport services being delivered to juvenile clients. Services will now provide care for non-clinical behavioral support \ncounseling to clinical, individual and family therapy, as well as intensive wrap-around therapeutic services. The new contract \nadded capacity for the department to serve non-system involved youth as well, increasing the ability to provide prevention \nservices to youth and families in the community.",

Farrah, Chief Probation Officer \nPublic Protection/Detention & Corrections \n \n \n \n \nH-78 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \n\u2022 \nLeveraging advancements in technology, the department upgraded the Juvenile Detention Facility's security system by \nreplacing the traditional magnetometer (metal detector) with state-of-the-art millimeter wave body scanners and micro-dose \nx-ray body scanners. These cutting-edge scanners enhance the facility's ability to detect contraband by providing \ncomprehensive screening capabilities. The millimeter wave scanner effectively identifies concealed items down to the skin \nlevel without the use of ionizing radiation, ensuring safety and compliance with health standards. Meanwhile, the micro-dose \nx-ray scanner allows for more detailed and precise screening, further improving security and reducing the risk of contraband \nentering the facility. \n\u2022 \nThe department purchased the building at 460 Union Avenue in Fairfield, with one-time 2011 Public Safety Realignment (AB \n109) funding. Upon completion of building improvements, the space will house the Fairfield Center for Positive Change as \nwell as a space to provide services for individuals reentering the community upon release from jail. \nWORKLOAD INDICATORS \n\u2022 \nThe department has continued to work in collaboration with the Sheriff\u2019s Enforcement Team (SET) and local law enforcement \nagencies to conduct compliance checks and DUI Checkpoints.

The Probation Awareness and Compliance Team \n(PACT) continues to enhance prosocial community engagement by participating in community events and sharing what we \ndo with the public. \n\u2022 \nThe Pretrial Unit screened 1,929 cases in FY2024/25 with a 27% increase in total active pretrial clients from last fiscal year. \nThere was also a 24% increase from last fiscal year in high-risk offenders, who scored high on the pretrial dynamic risk/needs \nassessment tool, the Ohio Risk Assessment System (ORAS). The overall success rate for pretrial clients has remained \nrelatively stable at 82% this fiscal year. A noteworthy increased expense is that Pretrial clients placed on electronic monitoring \nincreased 78.7% from last fiscal year. \n\u2022 \nThe department has housed a total of 110 clients and utilizes 12 different Sober Living Environments (SLE). There are \napproximately 32 clients at SLEs and nine clients in Volunteers of America (VOA) interim housing. Emergency housing, such \nas hotels are utilized in emergent situations. \n\u2022 \nThe CPC received 449 referrals for various services. Staff led 13 groups for cognitive behavioral therapy, including Thinking \nfor a Change and Reasoning and Rehabilitation resulting in 79 clients successfully completing these evidence-based \ninterventions. Three anger management groups were completed with 15 successful completions. There were seven Seeking \nSafety groups with 67 successful completions, as well as two new financial literacy groups with 10 clients successfully \ncompleting the assigned interventions. \n\nFunctional Area Summary \n6650 \u2013 Fund 900-Probation \n \nDean J.

Farrah, Chief Probation Officer \n \nPublic Protection/Detention & Corrections \n \n \n \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nH-83 \nSTAFFING TREND \n \nPENDING ISSUES AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS \nOn November 5, 2024, Proposition 36, known as \u201cThe Homelessness, Drug Addiction, and Theft Reduction Act\u201d was passed and \nwent into effect on December 18, 2024. Prop. 36 modifies existing law and adds substantive charges and enhancements to areas \nof the Penal Code and Health and Safety Code regarding theft, property damage, and drug-related crimes. It establishes a \nTreatment Mandated Felony option which is triggered by meeting certain criteria and prior drug convictions. The department is \nworking collaboratively with the court, Behavioral Health, and the Sheriff\u2019s Office to address the impacts. The department has \nbegun to absorb these additional clients in pretrial and will continue to monitor the impact and needs for services moving forward. \nAB 1051 went into effect on July 1, 2024, which modified the conditions and requirements for presumptive transfer to occur when \na child or youth in foster care is placed in certain out-of-county residential settings. The department continues to serve and locate \nout of home placements for the most intensive, at-risk youth. As Solano County does not have local youth placements, adherence \nto the passage of AB 1051 modified the presumptive transfer protocol by establishing the requirement of contracts by the county \nof original jurisdiction prior to placement of a youth in an out-of-county Short Term Residential Therapeutic Program (STRTP). \nThe legislative impact has created delays for counties; however, Probation continues to collaborate with Behavioral Health and \nChild Welfare to ensure that contracts and payments are arranged for services. \nIn Pretrial services, the use of electronic monitoring has become an overutilized practice, resulting in increased annual costs. \nTerms and conditions of pretrial releases are increasing, requiring higher levels of active involvement by probation officers. \nAdditionally, actively supervising lower risk pretrial clients, which has historically been reserved for high-risk offenders, while \nsatisfying the requirement to complete court report deadlines is an ongoing challenge. Utilization of Pretrial services to provide \nsupervision to clients going through competency proceedings or on diversion is also an increasing trend.",

In March 2017, \nthe Probation Department revised its contract with the telephone company providing collect call services to the youth detained at \nJDF to reduce the amount of transaction fees charged and eliminated commissions received for these services in order to \nencourage youths to contact their families. As a result, there will be no new revenue in the future. The department maintains a \nfund balance from prior years\u2019 collections and is utilizing those funds as the primary funding source for the department. Interest \nIncome on the balance of the funds continues to accrue. \nThe money in the Ward Welfare Fund must be expended by the Probation Department for the benefit, education, and welfare of \nthe youth detained within the JDF or other juvenile facilities. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents a decrease of $818 or 17.0% in revenue and an increase of $34,000 or 3400.0% in \nappropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. As a result, the Fund Balance is decreased by $31,000. \nThe appropriations reflect anticipated expenditures for the education, benefit, and welfare of youth detained in JDF. The decrease \nin revenues reflects lower interest income based on interest yield. \nFixed Assets \nNone. \nSee related Budget Unit 9151 \u2013 Fund 035 Contingencies (refer to Contingencies section of the Budget). \n \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS \nNone. \nSUMMARY OF POSITION CHANGES \nThere are no positions allocated to this budget. \nPENDING ISSUES AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS \nThere are no pending issues or policy considerations at this time. \nDETAIL BY REVENUE\nCATEGORY AND\nAPPROPRIATION CATEGORY\n2023/24\n ACTUAL\n2024/25 \nADOPTED\nBUDGET\n2025/26\nRECOMMENDED\nFROM\nADOPTED TO\nRECOMMENDED\nPERCENT\nCHANGE\nREVENUES\nREVENUE FROM USE OF MONEY/PROP\n5,111\n4,818\n4,000\n(818)\n(17.0%)\nTOTAL REVENUES\n5,111\n4,818\n4,000\n(818)\n(17.0%)\nAPPROPRIATIONS\nOTHER CHARGES\n715\n1,000\n35,000\n34,000\n3400.0%\nTOTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n715\n1,000\n35,000\n34,000\n3400.0%\nCHANGE IN FUND BALANCE\n(4,395)\n(3,818)\n31,000\n34,818\n(911.9%)",

The \nAgricultural Commissioner / Sealer of Weights and Measures \nis licensed by the Secretary of the California Department of \nFood and Agriculture (CDFA) and is appointed by the Board \nof Supervisors. Specific duties and responsibilities of the \ndepartment are enumerated in the provisions of the Food and \nAgricultural Code and the Business and Professions Code. \nThe department is responsible for the implementation and \nenforcement of specified State laws and regulations, and \nlocal ordinances; as well as other duties as assigned or \ndirected by the Board. \nBudget Summary: \nFY2024/25 Midyear Projection: \n7,013,550 \nFY2025/26 Recommended: \n7,487,474 \nCounty General Fund Contribution: \n3,337,777 \nPercent County General Fund Supported: \n44.6% \nTotal Employees (FTEs): \n28 \n \nFUNCTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES \nThe Agricultural Commissioner\u2019s Office is responsible for protecting and promoting agriculture in the county. This is accomplished \nthrough its Pesticide Use Enforcement, Pest Prevention, Export Certification, and Inspection Services programs. \nThe Sealer of Weights and Measures verifies equity in commercial transactions through device, weighmaster, petroleum products, \nquantity control, and point-of sale (price scanner) inspections. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nChallenges: \n\u2022 \nThe department is continuing its efforts toward complete eradication of the glassy-winged sharpshooter infestation in \nVacaville\u2019s Browns Valley neighborhood. Sharpshooter detections dropped from 51 in 2021, 78 in 2022, 13 in 2023, to 5 in \n2024. Surveys, trapping, insecticide treatments, and biocontrol releases are ongoing in 2025. The infestation remains confined \nto the originally established quarantine boundary. Complete eradication remains challenging because the Browns Valley area \nhas an abundance of host plants like crepe myrtle and citrus trees favored by the glassy-winged sharpshooter and some \nproperty owners are refusing access for surveys and treatments. The department pursued a mandatory abatement process \nin 2025 to complete treatments on refusal properties where glassy-winged sharpshooters were detected. The department \nprojects a decrease in eradication activity in FY2025/26 due to the trending decrease in the number of pest finds. Accordingly, \nCDFA funding for eradication activities is expected to decrease by 54% in FY2025/26.",

Progress included \nhiring consultants to assist in developing agricultural economic infrastructure and land use plans, and forming project advisory \ncommittees comprised of agricultural producers, County, city and other agency staff as well as other stakeholders. \n\u2022 \nThe department surveyed over 590 properties and made treatments to 834 parcels in efforts to eradicate the glassy-winged \nsharpshooter from Vacaville during 2024. \n\u2022 \nIn 2024, biologists intercepted 93 high-risk invasive pests in incoming packages destined for Solano and neighboring county \ncommunities at local shipping terminal facilities and issued 343 notices of rejection for shipments containing pests or failing \nto meet import requirements. High-risk pest interceptions increased 135% in 2024 compared to 2023 due to more staff time \nassigned to terminal inspections leading to additional pest finds in shipments from non-compliant nurseries in the southeastern \nUnited States. \n\u2022 \nIn FY2023/24, for the twelfth consecutive year, the County met eligibility requirements to receive disbursement of unrefunded \ngasoline tax funds paid on fuel used for off-highway agricultural purposes by maintaining County General Fund support for \nagricultural programs at least equal to the average amount expended for the five preceding years resulting in $1,854,837, or \nan estimated 43%, of the department\u2019s revenue in FY2024/25. \nWORKLOAD INDICATORS \nDuring FY2023/24, Agricultural Biologists / Weights and Measures Inspectors accomplished the following work: \n\u2022 \nIssued 434 pesticide permits, conducted 305 pesticide use and safety inspections, issued 47 violation notices and warning \nletters and closed 31 pesticide use administrative penalties. \n\u2022 \nInspected 330 agricultural fields covering 4,809 acres for phytosanitary certifications. \n\u2022 \nIssued 625 federal export certificates of inspection for commodity shipments to 34 different countries and issued 315 inter- \nand intra-state commodity inspection certifications. \n\u2022 \nInspected 10,211 incoming shipments for pests of concern and completed 24,127 monitoring checks of 2,462 pest detection \ntraps. \n\u2022 \nCompleted 6,463 weighing and measuring device inspections at 949 commercial locations, 6 weighmaster audits, 128 \npetroleum inspections, 153 price verification inspections and issued 519 violation notices. \n\n2830 \u2013 Fund 001-Agricultural Commissioner/Weights & Measures \nFunctional Area Summary \nEd King, Agricultural Commissioner/Sealer of Weights & Measures \nProtection & Inspect \n \n \n \nH-88 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \n \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents a net decrease of $334,615 or 7.5% in revenues and a net decrease of $160,242 or 2.1% \nin appropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. As a result, the Net County Cost increased by $174,373. \nPrimary Funding Sources \nThe primary funding sources for the department are County General Fund and Intergovernmental Revenues. Intergovernmental \nRevenues are mainly received from the State and are associated with various contracted agricultural inspection services, other \nmandated and subvented agricultural activities and pesticide use enforcement work, grants, and unrefunded gasoline tax used for \noff-highway agricultural purposes. These contract and gasoline tax revenues are driven by workloads and associated staffing \nlevels. \nThe department\u2019s other significant funding sources are: (1) Licenses, Permits and Franchise revenue received in the form of user \nfees for weights and measures device registration, pest control business registrations and other inspections and certifications \nprovided by the department, and (2) Charges for Services, which are received for various agricultural and weights and measures \ninspections. \nThe Recommended Budget includes a net decrease of $334,615 in revenues primarily due to decreases in the overall amount of \nintergovernmental revenue from the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA). \n\u2022 \nLicenses, Permits and Franchise revenues, inclusive of weights and measures device registration fees and pest control \nbusiness registration fees, reflect an increase of $50,300. \n\u2022 \nIntergovernmental Revenues reflect a net decrease of $409,071 primarily due to a decrease in glassy-winged sharpshooter \nfunding due to an anticipated reduction in workload for an eradication project in the Brown\u2019s Valley area in Vacaville, offset \nby increases in unclaimed gas tax reimbursement and SALC grant funds. \n\u2022 \nCharges for Services reflect an increase of $14,156 primarily due to an increase in Nursery Master Permit inspections. \nPrimary Costs \nThe Recommended Budget includes a net decrease of $160,242 in appropriations due to the following: \n\u2022 \nSalaries and Employee Benefits reflect a decrease of $72,964 primarily due to the expiration of one vacant Limited-Term \nSenior Agricultural Biologist/Weights and Measure Inspector position on June 30, 2025, offset by increases in retirement and \nhealth benefit costs. \nDETAIL BY REVENUE\nAND APPROPRIATION\nPERCENT\nFUNCTIONAL AREA\nCHANGE\nREVENUES\n AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER/WEIGHTS & MEASURE\n3,068,337\n \n4,484,312\n \n4,149,697\n \n(334,615)\n \n (7.5%)\nTOTAL REVENUES\n3,068,337\n \n4,484,312\n \n4,149,697\n \n(334,615)\n \n (7.5%)\nAPPROPRIATIONS\n AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER/WEIGHTS & MEASURE\n6,475,046\n \n7,647,716\n \n7,487,474\n \n(160,242)\n \n (2.1%)\nTOTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n6,475,046\n \n7,647,716\n \n7,487,474\n \n(160,242)\n \n (2.1%)\nNET COUNTY COST\n AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER/WEIGHTS & MEASURE\n3,406,709\n \n3,163,404\n \n3,337,777\n \n174,373\n \n5.5%\nNET COUNTY COST\n3,406,709\n \n3,163,404\n \n3,337,777\n \n174,373\n \n5.5%\nSTAFFING\nAGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER / WEIGHTS & MEASURE\n28\n28\n28\n0\n0.0%\nTOTAL STAFFING\n28\n28\n28\n0\n0.0%\nACTUAL\nBUDGET\nRECOMMENDED\nRECOMMENDED\n2024/25\nFROM\n2023/24\nADOPTED\n2025/26\nADOPTED TO",

At this time there has been no reduction in this funding source. The department remains attentive to any federal \npause/reduction in pass-through funding for these programs. \nUnrefunded gasoline tax paid on fuel used for off-highway agricultural purposes is the department\u2019s single largest revenue source \noutside County General Fund. The Agricultural Commissioner\u2019s Association is reviewing future options to replace this funding \nstream as California gradually transitions away from gasoline-powered vehicles and equipment. Despite steady increases in \nalternative fuels, unrefunded gasoline tax payments to county agriculture departments in FY2025/26 are forecast to be consistent \nwith FY2024/25 amounts, pending release of Caltrans\u2019 2025 Unrefunded Agricultural Gasoline Tax report to the State legislature. \nThe department continues to strive toward eradicating the glassy-winged sharpshooter in Vacaville with only five pest detections \nin 2024. As a result of this ongoing success, fewer project staffing and contractor resources are forecast to be needed in \nFY2025/26; therefore, the department\u2019s FY2025/26 CDFA project funding will be reduced accordingly. Simultaneously, two new \ninfestations in northern California are now drawing on a limited amount of funding available for glassy-winged sharpshooter \neradication activities; however, as the Vacaville project approaches complete eradication the department anticipates that CDFA \nwill be able to continue to provide necessary funding support. \nCDFA is currently funding county high-risk pest exclusion programs at $3.1 million per year which is $2.4 million below the statutory \nmandated funding amount of $5.5 million annually. In FY2023/24, the department\u2019s pest exclusion workload exceeded available \nCDFA high-risk pest exclusion cooperative agreement funding by nearly $92,000; a balance that had to be supported by the \nCounty General Fund and unclaimed gas tax reimbursement. \nThe Agricultural Commissioners and Sealers Association (CACASA) sponsored AB 2037 (Papan), established County Sealer \njurisdiction over electric vehicle (EV) charging systems owned or operated by a city or county beginning January 1, 2026. There \nare 175 municipally owned/operated EV charging systems which is 31% of all commercial EV systems in the county. Although \nbeneficial to consumers, the new legislation will increase department workload.",

As the costs for providing these services and implementing these programs increases, the \ndepartment will continue to balance its mission to provide services to the public and business community and to protect public \nhealth and safety, while also evaluating methods to generate additional revenue and implement control costs to limit impacts \nto businesses and the General Fund. \n\u2022 \nCurrently, the department continues to experience a high-level of permit activity, resulting in additional demands from the \npublic and businesses for assistance and service, which must be balanced with meeting mandated State inspection or \nprogram implementation requirements. These requirements continue to place increased demands on staff and the department \nis shifting available staff based on current workload as well as implementing a variety of technology improvements, from \nelectronic plan review to computer-to-computer data transfers with State agencies to help increase staff efficiencies. \nAccomplishments: \n\u2022 \nThe Board adopted the 6th Cycle Housing Element update (Years 2023 - 2031) which was certified by the State on April 9, \n2024. Implementation of the Housing Element is ongoing, and the County is seeking options to increase residential \ndevelopment in the unincorporated areas, including providing programs and incentives to encourage additional ADU \ndevelopment. \n\u2022 \nThe Building and Safety Services Division plan checked and permitted large commercial projects including an upgrade to a \nwine processing facility, an event center, a retail building, several large commercial photovoltaic solar arrays, a new museum \nbuilding and a new auction facility for a total valuation of $21 million. \n\u2022 \nAn update to the General Plan\u2019s Public Health and Safety Chapter was adopted in December 2024. The update focused on \nbringing the Chapter up to date with recent statutory requirements relating to climate change vulnerabilities, resilience, and \nnatural hazards. \n\u2022 \nThe Building and Safety Services Division was recertified by FEMA and the Community Rating System Program for properly \nenforcing flood-resistant construction standards in flood zones, maintaining a 15% discount on flood insurance for County \nresidents. \n\u2022 \nThe Homeacres Owner Occupied Rehabilitation (OOR) Program is underway to address health and safety issues for property \nowners in the Homeacres neighborhood of Vallejo. As of March 2025, four $80,000 loans and one $15,000 grant have been \nawarded for home rehabilitation projects and twenty-three Flock safety cameras have been installed under a two-year pilot \nprogram that has resulted in the identification of 2,593 lost or stolen license plates, 110 stolen vehicles, and 2 felony vehicles. \n\u2022 \nThe Planning Services Division facilitated the Board\u2019s adoption of a Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance (WELO) per the \nCalifornia Water Conservation in Landscaping Act, ensuring County compliance with State regulations and improving clarity \nfor County residents and businesses regarding the applicable water efficient landscaping requirements. \n\u2022 \nThe Board approved changes to Chapter 10 - Abatement of Public Nuisance, Chapter 14 \u2013 Business Licenses and Chapter \n28 \u2013 Zoning, resulting in a greater degree of compliance with code violations, as well as an increase in code violation fee \nrevenue. \n\u2022 \nThe Large Lot Final Subdivision Map for the Middle Green Valley Specific Plan (MGVSP) was recorded.

As a result, the Net County Cost decreased by $553,053 or \n8.1%. \nPrimary Funding Sources: \nThe primary funding source for the department are fees charged for permits and services with the remaining funding coming from \ngrants, contracts, and the General Fund. \nThe Recommended Budget includes a net increase of $629,190 in revenues primarily due to the following: \n\u2022 \nLicenses, Permits and Franchises revenue of $8,594,866 reflect a net increase of $406,397 primarily due to increases in fees \nand permits related to food facilities, hazardous materials, pools and spas, and land use zoning. This is offset by a decrease \nin building permit revenues resulting from a decline in construction, fewer anticipated large projects, and slower than \nanticipated LNU fire rebuilding. \n\u2022 \nCharges for Services of $2,380,463 reflect an increase of $213,435 primarily due to an increase in expenditures reimbursed \nby other funding sources for administrative services provided to the Public Works and Parks and Recreation Divisions and an \nincrease in code violation penalty fees. \nPrimary Costs \nThe Recommended Budget includes a net increase of $76,137 in appropriations primarily due to the following: \n\u2022 \nSalaries and Employee Benefits reflect an increase of $365,615 primarily due to increased wages, retirement and health \nbenefit costs and the addition of an Assistant Director position on March 11, 2025 as part of the Midyear Financial Report. \n\u2022 \nOther Charges reflect a decrease of $201,426 primarily due to a decrease in Countywide Administrative Overhead costs, the \ncompletion of the Housing Element update, and a one-time write-off in FY2024/25 of uncollectable receivables from 2010 \nthrough 2012. \n\u2022 \nOther Financing Uses reflect a decrease of $102,683 due to the full redemption of the Pension Obligation Bonds (POBs). \nContracts \nThe FY2025/26 Recommended Budget includes the following significant contracts: \nContractual and Other Professional Work that is revenue offset includes: \n\u2022 \n$475,000 for lead assessment, abatement, and project management reimbursed by lead paint settlement funds. \n\u2022 \n$435,793 for work to implement energy efficiency programs countywide, paid by the Association of Bay Area Governments \nas part of the BayREN Program. \n\u2022 \n$225,000 for environmental consultant work, paid by applicants. \n\u2022 \n$200,985 for Accela support and enhancement, reimbursed by permit fee revenue. \n\u2022 \n$90,000 for a contractor to assist with K-12 educational fieldtrips and community cleanups, paid from integrated waste \nrevenues. \nContractual and Other Professional Work that is General Fund supported includes: \n\u2022 \n$340,000 for assistance with various planning projects. \n\u2022 \n$100,000 for the General Plan Update. \nFixed Assets \nNone. \n\n2910 \u2013 Fund 001-Resource Management \nFunctional Area Summary \nJames Bezek, Director of Resource Management \nOther Protection \n \n \n \nH-98 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nDEPARTMENT COMMENTS \nThe department is driven largely by permit activity, proposed projects, special projects to address Board priorities, and work to \nmeet State requirements. During FY2025/26, the department will be involved in several ongoing and new projects. These include \nstaff participation in updating the General Plan, involvement in economic development activities including implementation of the \npriorities identified in the Board Priority Setting Session, implementation of SB 54 plastic pollution prevention program, a highway \ninterchange study, revising Williamson Act uniform rules, and evaluating Pleasants Valley Road zoning changes. \nThe County continues implementation of the Lead-Based Paint Abatement program from a settlement award (approximately $4.9 \nmillion) from a joint lawsuit filed against the paint industry by Solano County and nine other counties and cities. This funding is \nbeing used for implementing an outreach, education and abatement program with the goal of mitigating lead-impacted homes with \nyoung children throughout the county. Several recipient jurisdictions of the settlement funds are experiencing delays and difficulties \nwith assessment and abatement based upon shortages of qualified and available contractors to perform remediations. A pilot \nproject with five properties is currently underway in the county, with lead assessments now complete and abatement work in \nprogress. Based upon the results of this pilot project, either full rollout will commence, or staff may need to find alternative methods \nfor remediation which may impact the total number of remediations completed and extend the timeline for full completion of the \nprogram. \nThe department will begin several significant, long-term, countywide planning updates including amending Chapter 28 zoning \nregulations, developing a Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) ordinance, creating an agricultural land mitigation program and \nrevising Williamson Act uniform rules. \nPlanning staff commenced a Highway Interchange Study to evaluate eight key interchanges in the unincorporated county to \nexplore additional opportunities for economic development. Much of the unincorporated land between city limits is valuable and \nintended for future development, often situated at or around highway interchanges. It is the goal of this feasibility study to evaluate \nsolutions to unlock parcels within county jurisdiction for affordable housing and economic development potential. \nPlanning staff continued work on the Pleasants Valley Road corridor zoning analysis. The analysis looks at potential opportunities \nto increase land use flexibility in the area to provide for more value-added agricultural uses. The County continues to evaluate \npotential zoning changes in the Pleasants Valley Road corridor area and revisions are intended to provide additional flexibility to \nincorporate value-added land uses to existing agricultural operations. \nIn collaboration with the UC Davis Cooperative Extension, the department is finalizing a farm stand brochure to create a \ntransparent, step-by-step document intended to expedite permitting and promote county agritourism. County permit fees and \ntimelines, product sales thresholds and onsite growing requirements are outlined. Additional incentives include of the provision of \nsignage at no additional fee, for promotion of farm stands and reductions of administrative permit fees. \n \nSOURCE OF FUNDS \n \nUSE OF FUNDS",

Staff provide support to the Board of Supervisors, the \nBoard\u2019s Legislative Committee, and County departments in evaluating water-related legislation and bond initiatives, regulations, \nand policy and project development. \nFUNCTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES \nThis budget unit addresses federal, State, and local water-related planning and project proposals with potential impacts to Solano \nCounty. These include the ever-changing Delta Water Tunnel plan to convey water supplies south via a new, single, large-scale \ntunnel infrastructure, posing significant impacts to the Delta region, including Solano County. State and federal proposed flood \ninfrastructure improvements and habitat restoration programs, such as those in the Cache Slough and the Yolo Bypass region, \nalso have direct and indirect impacts on agricultural lands within the County\u2019s jurisdictional area, if implemented. Division staff \nprovide technical support to various water/Delta-related committees including the Solano Subbasin Groundwater Sustainability \nAgency, Delta Counties Coalition, Yolo Bypass Partnership, and the Solano Water Agency Commission. The division is staffed \nwith a program manager and a hydro-geological analyst position, with support from other technical professionals in the Department \nof Resource Management, as well as utilization of consultants and contractors. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nChallenges: \n\u2022 \nThe division faces continued demands on staff resources as it works to complete the Cache Slough Habitat Conservation \nPlan (HCP) to secure long-term endangered species incidental take permits for continued water intake capabilities for \nagricultural operations in the Cache Slough region. The administrative draft HCP was submitted to federal and State wildlife \nagencies for review in November 2022; however, due to limited availability of federal staff, efforts toward completing the HCP \nstalled until January 2025 when the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) signed agreements to fund US Fish \nand Wildlife Service (USFWS) and US National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) staff to finalize the HCP. Division staff, \nalong with DWR and federal agency staff, are coordinating to complete the HCP through FY2025/26. Upon successful \ncompletion of the HCP, division staff and DWR will develop associated environmental documents to comply with the California \nEnvironmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and apply for 30-year incidental take \npermits. \n\u2022 \nFlood risk reduction remains a critical priority, with division staff coordinating closely with the DWR, local reclamation district, \nand flood management engineers on State funded projects in the Cache Slough Region and Suisun Marsh. Efforts are focused \non securing funding for levee improvements and strengthening flood protection measures. \n\u2022 \nGroundwater sustainability efforts continue, with staff actively participating in technical advisory groups and supporting \nimplementation of the Solano Subbasin Groundwater Sustainability Plan (GSP). Work includes development updates and \nidentifying key management actions in coordination with various Groundwater Sustainability Agencies (GSAs) in developing \nannual and five-year updates to the GSP to support long-term water resource sustainably. \n\u2022 \nRegional coordination remains essential, particularly in monitoring larger-scale projects such as the proposed Delta \nConveyance Project and the State Water Resources Control Board\u2019s efforts to update the Sacramento Bay-Delta Plan. \nProposed unimpaired flows requirements under an updated Bay Delta Plan would have direct impacts on the county\u2019s water \nsupply. Staff remains engaged with the Delta Counties Coalition, participating in public outreach efforts and collaborating on \nstate and federal planning processes that could affect the County. Additionally, the division is evaluating the water supply and \ninfrastructure implications of any new major development in the unincorporated eastern Solano County. \nAccomplishments: \n\u2022 \nAmerican Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) - Continued coordination with County departments and other local agencies toward \nprogressing priority water, wastewater, and drainage infrastructure projects to completion. In 2022, the Board directed \n$7,595,500 in ARPA funds toward eleven water resources infrastructure projects of which six projects have been completed \nor near completion. As part of implementation, staff conducted field visits and inspections for ARPA-funded infrastructure",

Staff collaborated with engineers and contractors to review designs, assess construction progress, and ensure \ncompliance with project requirements. During this process, it was identified that the full Solano 360 drainage improvement \nproject would not be able to be completed within the timeline for ARPA expenditure; therefore, the project was scaled back \nto design and environmental work and $3,500,000 of the $5,000,000 originally allocated to the project was reallocated to \nanother ARPA project leaving the total ARPA allocation for water resources infrastructure projects at $4,095,500 Staff will \ncontinue to work with consultants to complete the remaining five projects, including the design of the Solano 360 drainage \nimprovement project, through FY2025/26. \n\u2022 \nRegulatory and Environmental Reviews: Staff reviewed and developed comments for department and county consideration \non ten major environmental assessments and impact reports associated with the Delta or water resources. In addition, staff \ntracked and coordinated with state and federal lobbyists numerous proposed state and federal legislation that could affect the \nCounty. Ongoing participation in environmental review ensures that County interests are considered in regional and statewide \nDelta and water projects. \n\u2022 \nHabitat Conservation and Outreach: Staff continued to participate in the development of the Cache Slough HCP through \nsteering committee and technical meetings. Staff developed and updated outreach materials and presented to landowners at \ntwo reclamation district board meetings, ensuring stakeholders remain informed about HCP developments. \n\u2022 \nClimate and Drought Planning: Staff actively engaged in the countywide Drought Task Force and planning efforts as \nrequired through Senate Bill (SB) 552.

Staff also worked on the Solano Bayshore Resiliency Project in partnership with the Fairfield-Suisun \nSewer District, the cities of Fairfield, Suisun City, Vallejo and Benicia and key stakeholders. The Solano Bayshore Resiliency \nProject was awarded two state grants totaling $1,992,000 which provide funding to support county staff and staff from the \nparticipating cities, agencies and consultants in their efforts to develop a multi-jurisdictional plan addressing sea level rise and \nflood risk mitigation over the next two years. \n\u2022 \nWater Quality, Flood, and Wastewater Compliance: Staff participated in regional flood management and water quality \ninitiatives, contributing technical expertise to discussions on flood protection strategies and environmental impacts. \nAdditionally, staff worked with the Regional Board and County Environmental Health to assess wastewater discharge \nrequirements, including coordinated field inspections at wineries under the Regional Water Quality Control Board Winery \nGeneral Order, and review stormwater compliance measures related to development projects such as the Sacramento River \nSettlement Contractors Environmental Impact Report (EIR). \n\u2022 \nDelta Conveyance \u201cTunnel\u201d Project: Staff, in coordination with consultants, other agencies and legal counsel, continue to \ntrack the State\u2019s effort and provide comments regarding impacts to Solano County and Delta communities associated with \nthe Tunnel project. On February 22, 2024, the State Water Resources Control Board received DWR\u2019s request to change the \nwater rights to implement the Tunnel project. Staff continue to coordinate with counsel and other Delta County agencies in \nlegal opposition on the project\u2019s potential impacts to the County and Delta region. \n\u2022 \nWater Resources Master Planning: Through ARPA funding, staff and a consulting team continue to develop an integrated \nwater resources framework (One Water Framework) to support the development of goals, objectives, and actions for the \nSolano County Utilities Master Plan. The Utilities Master Plan will include multi-benefit projects that support all existing water \nsystems in unincorporated Solano County, with a focus on water systems which support vulnerable, underserved, or \ndisadvantaged communities and/or advance the agricultural economy, including farmland, agriculture-supported businesses, \nagricultural worker housing, and agricultural tourism. Development of the One Water Framework will continue through \nFY2025/26. Development of the Water Resources component of the Utilities Master Plan depends on available funding and \nstaff resources. Staff is actively pursuing grants and other funding opportunities to initiate the development of the Utilities \nMaster Plan.",

The OOR Program is underway and aims to enhance the quality of life for residents, preserve \naffordable housing, and revitalize the community. As of March 2025, 14 applications for the program have been received, four \n$80,000 loans and one $15,000 grant have been awarded to improve health and safety standards of homes, including abating \nsubstandard housing conditions and bringing homes up to accessibility standards.

These cameras \nin the Homeacres neighborhood have resulted in the identification of 2,593 lost or stolen license plates, 110 stolen vehicles, and \ntwo felony vehicles. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents a decrease of $20,902 or 37.4% in revenues and an increase of $671,999 or 260.1% in \nappropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. There is no County Contribution to this fund. \nPrimary Funding Sources \nThe primary source of revenue to the fund is interest earnings and loan payoffs when they occur. Additional unanticipated \nrevenue from loan repayments may be received during the fiscal year.

For these programs, funds are passed through the County to the administration agencies. Each division within the \nbudget unit maintains its own dedicated Fund Balance. The principal and current budgetary activities are: \n1517 Housing Authority \nThe Solano County Housing Authority (SCHA), under an agreement with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (HUD), provides housing assistance through the Section 8 Housing Assistance Program for the unincorporated \nareas of Solano County and the cities of Dixon and Rio Vista. From inception in 1978, SCHA has contracted out for the day-\nto-day administration and financial management of the Section 8 Housing Assistance Program and its companion Family Self-\nSufficiency Program (Programs). In July 2002, the SCHA entered into a contractual agreement with the City of Vacaville \nHousing Authority (VHA) for the administration and financial management of the Programs. \nThe Board of Supervisors serve as the SCHA Board. The Department of Resource Management, as staff to the SCHA, is \nresponsible for the administration of contracts with HUD and the contractual agreements for housing program administration \nwith the City of Vacaville. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents an increase of $598,111 or 16.2% in revenue and an increase of $500,000 or 13.2% in \nappropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget, resulting in no change to Fund Balance.

The division is responsible for public \naccess, public safety, and maintenance operations of three campgrounds, two picnic areas, one sand beach, two motorized and \none small craft boat launches, two fishing piers, two trail access and staging areas, and the Lake Solano Nature Center. Additional \nresponsibilities include ongoing cleaning and maintenance of over 200-acres of turf, landscaping, 20-miles of multi-use trails, \npaved roads and parking lots, restrooms and shower buildings, a fishing pond, water wells, sewage systems, exhibits, and other \npark facilities, assets and equipment. \nThe division, with the assistance of two contracted volunteer coordinators, administers a Park Volunteer Program that provides \ncamp hosts, docent tours, environmental education programs, and volunteer labor for trail and environmental restoration projects. \nThe division also manages contracts and ensures completion of work to improve fish and wildlife education and habitat restoration \nefforts awarded through the County\u2019s Fish and Wildlife Propagation Fund. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nChallenges: \n\u2022 \nAttendance levels continue to see similar growth as in recent years. Lynch Canyon Open Space experienced increased \nattendance. These high attendance levels (over 240,000 yearly visitors to the parks) directly increase the amount of \nmaintenance and customer service activities performed by staff at a time when recruitments for extra help Park Aides \ncontinue to yield low levels of interest. Ultimately, the additional workload impacts staff retention, customer service, and \nprotection and maintenance of the parks. The division continues to evaluate staffing models to improve recruitment and \nretention. \n\u2022 \nIncreased attendance outside of the traditional peak season continues to result in difficulties scheduling some of the smaller \nprojects to maintain and improve the parks. \n\u2022 \nThe division is coordinating multiple priority capital projects, including electrical and plumbing infrastructure improvements, \nlaunch facility upgrades and paving surface upgrades. These projects will continue into FY2025/26 and are supported by a \nvariety of funding sources, including the Consolidated Appropriations Act, Federal Lands Highway, American Rescue Plan \nAct, and grant programs. Various federal and State partner agencies are assisting with the project funding and/or work. \nThese projects are expected to begin in the last quarter of FY2024/25 and continue through into the third quarter of \nFY2025/26. For many of these projects the construction phases will occur during peak season and the division is preparing \nto mitigate the negative impacts on revenue and attendance levels in the campground and boat launch area of Lake Solano \nPark and the day use and boat launch area of Sandy Beach Park. \nAccomplishments: \n\u2022 \nThe division continues to participate with partners such as California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Audubon Society \nfor wildlife habitat and migratory wildlife studies. \n\u2022 \nStaff continue to exhibit their dedication to the public. Staff regularly adapt park operations to meet the needs of the visiting \npublic. Working with partners such as Solano Resource Conservation District and the Putah Creek Council, staff continue to \nprovide environmental education programs and native plant revegetation of Lake Solano Park. These efforts serve to repair \ndamages caused by a multitude of factors including weather related incidents (fire/flood), long-term climate changes, public \naccess, and a targeted replacement of nonnative plants and trees with their native counter parts, thus bolstering the native \nhabitat.",

These units receive general direction from the Director of Resource Management, have administrative authority over \nthe unincorporated areas of the county, and provide a variety of legally mandated and non-mandated programs and services as \nsummarized below: \nPublic Works Operations\u2019 primary responsibilities are to: \n\u2022 \nMaintain 576 miles of County roads and bridges, including pavement surfaces, roadside drainage ditches and culverts, \nvegetation management, signing and striping, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, and gravel roads. \n\u2022 \nMaintain 94 bridges and 51 large drainage culverts, including the bridge/culvert structures, the roadway surfaces, and the \nassociated drainage channels within the road right-of-way. \n\u2022 \nPerform maintenance work on road, airport, parking lot, and drainage facilities for County departments, cities, and other \nagencies on a reimbursable basis. \n\u2022 \nMaintain 58 miles of drainage channels under contract with the Solano County Water Agency. \nPublic Works Engineering\u2019s primary responsibilities are to: \n\u2022 \nDesign and construct County roads and bridges, including major road and bridge rehabilitation and reconstruction projects. \n\u2022 \nParticipate in regional transportation planning and the development of regional transportation projects as a member agency \nof the Solano Transportation Authority (STA). \n\n3010 \u2013 Fund 101-Public Works \nFunctional Area Summary \nJames Bezek, Director of Resource Management \nPublic Ways \n \n \n \nI-2 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \n\u2022 \nProvide traffic engineering services, including traffic orders and signage. \n\u2022 \nIssue various permits, including transportation, encroachment, grading and assembly permits. \n\u2022 \nProvide engineering, surveying and construction work on road, airport, parking lot, and drainage facilities for County \ndepartments, cities, and other agencies on a reimbursable basis. \n\u2022 \nContract with local public agencies to maintain Solano County\u2019s three traffic signals. \n\u2022 \nContract with local contractors to maintain Solano County\u2019s 590 existing streetlights and install additional lights as needed. \nCosts are reimbursed from the Consolidated County Service Area budget (BU 9746). \n\u2022 \nAdminister the County\u2019s storm water pollution prevention program. \nFederal Roads and Bridge Projects: \nPublic Works Engineering uses federal funds to pay for the replacement and rehabilitation of deficient bridges, the paving of \nfederally eligible roads, and the construction of road improvement projects. The funds come from a variety of federal programs \nand reimburse the County for project costs at a rate ranging from 80 to 100 percent, depending on the specific program. \nAdministrative Support: \nAdministration supports the operations and engineering divisions by handling incoming phone calls and inquiries, accounting, \nbudgeting, payroll, recordkeeping, inventory, fees, State reporting, State and federal audits, image processing and retention \nschedules, and data processing information system operations. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nChallenges: \n\u2022 \nIn FY2025/26, Public Works will begin delivering a series of federal aid projects that will add to the Department\u2019s construction \nworkload. The Stevenson Road Bridge Rehabilitation Project begins in FY2025/26 as a $10.5 million construction project that \nwill require extensive staffing and consulting resources to complete. In addition, the Department will begin delivery of $2.5 \nmillion in federal Highway Safety Improvement Program projects that will improve lighting, guardrail, and curve safety. \n\u2022 \nHiring and retaining experienced staff with the qualifications to perform higher level work continues to be a challenge due to \na very competitive market for experienced civil engineers and technicians. \n\u2022 \nThe cleanup of illegally dumped roadside solid waste continues to impact the availability of road crews to perform other road \nrepair and maintenance projects. Over the past five years, the cost to Public Works continues to increase, with an expected \nannual cost of approximately $250,000. The Department of Resource Management is collaborating across its divisions and \nwith the Sheriff\u2019s Office to address this issue, including more robust investigation and enforcement of illegal dumping. The \ndepartment created an illegal dumping crew in FY2019/20 to address the problem countywide. Clean up of homeless \nencampments requires continued staff training and personal protective equipment. One of the biggest cleanup challenges \nPublic Works faces is an increase in abandoned boats, travel trailers, and recreational vehicles in the County\u2019s right-of-way. \nPublic Works crews also partner with Integrated Waste Management staff within the department and other providers to recycle \nitems and reduce the amount of waste sent to disposal at the landfill. \n\u2022 \nSecuring funding to rehabilitate and reconstruct the County\u2019s aging bridges remains challenging. The federal bridge funding \nsystem is oversubscribed. With increased competition for funding, Public Works will continue to work with Caltrans to secure \nfunding for the Pedrick Road Bridge and Bunker Station Road Bridge. Although the County\u2019s culverts are not eligible for \nfederal funds, Public Works is working on small grant applications to fill funding gaps. \n\u2022 \nMeeting the State mandates for electric vehicle purchases will continue to be a very significant challenge given the cost of \nvehicle and charging stations, along with the limited availability of electricity access and provision within the County. \nAccomplishments: \n\u2022 \nMaintained a pavement condition index (PCI) of 80, which is an average of the County\u2019s road pavement conditions. This \nranking places Solano County roads in the \u201cvery good\u201d category and among the highest ranked jurisdictions in the Bay Area.",

The \nCounty has approximately 2,000 aging culverts that will require replacement, and this inspection process will aid in prioritizing \nthese culvert projects. The replacement of the larger culverts on Bucktown Road and Winters Road will take place in FY2025/26, \nas well as repair and replacement of approximately 50 smaller culverts. \nSince FY2019/20, Public Works began taking general inventory of its bridges, roads, signs, streetlights, striping and traffic signals, \ntracking their location, condition, size, material type and age using GIS software and existing staff resources. This data is used to \nassist with infrastructure needs assessments, planning future projects, scheduling of traffic-related asset replacement and real-\ntime web-based road closure reporting. GIS is also being used to track illegal dumping locations, improving enforcement efforts \nby the Sheriff\u2019s Office. Public Works will continue to expand the use of GIS mapping as well as implement asset management \noptions by expanding use of existing software systems. \nPublic Works operates corporation yards in Fairfield, Vacaville, Rio Vista, and Dixon. Most of the buildings at these locations were \nconstructed in the 1950s and 1960s and have not undergone major renovations since originally constructed. These aging facilities \nwill need to be demolished, replaced, or renovated in the near future. Public Works is working with the County Administrator\u2019s \nOffice and General Services to evaluate potential facility upgrades, consolidation and relocation to determine short and long-term \nplans for these facilities. \nPublic Works will continue to seek opportunities to collaborate with cities and regional agencies to pool resources, seek \ncollaborative grants, and to complete mutually beneficial projects. Such collaboration increases available funding for these regional \nroad projects, which attracts quality contractors and results in more competitive bids.

This position is fully funded by the Road Fund. \n\u2022 \nAdd 1.0 FTE Engineering Technician to expand project delivery capabilities as a result of a significant increase in Federal \nHighway Administration (FHWA) funding and new federal and state grants. This position is fully funded by the Road Fund. \n\u2022 \nReclassify 1.0 FTE Engineer Assistant to 1.0 FTE Civil Engineer to align the classification with the job duties being performed. \nSTAFFING TREND \n \nPENDING ISSUES AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS \nSB 1 revenues are modified by fluctuations in fuel consumption (the primary source of SB 1 revenue), inflation, and vehicle \nregistrations, which have been relatively stable over the last few years. Fuel consumption has been slightly declining in recent \nyears due to improved fuel efficiency and electric vehicle conversions. However, gas tax revenues are no longer directly tied to \nthe price of fuel so State projections show increasing gas tax revenues due to the rate of inflation outpacing the rate of decline in \nfuel consumption along with increased electric vehicle registrations. \nPublic Works slightly increased the project workload in the 5-Year Public Works Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) given the amount \nof federal aid grant awards for safety, Stevenson Bridge, and the Fairgrounds Mobility Hub. Projects around Travis Air Force Base \ncontinue to draw cooperative interest, being eligible for a variety of grant funding opportunities, but will require extensive planning \nand will take years to develop and deliver. Overall, the CIP contains $88 million in unfunded project costs, and therefore, Public \nWorks will seek all reasonable grant opportunities to complete these mutually beneficial projects. \nThe California Air Resources Board (CARB) has established phased requirements for electric vehicle and equipment purchases \nover the next decade. In order to operate an expanded electric vehicle fleet, Public Works will need to install significant electric \ncharging and grid supply improvements in the corporation yards to service these upcoming operational needs. The costs for the \nvehicles, equipment, charging, and supply is expected to escalate, making CARB mandates a significant issue for future budget \ncycles. \n \n \n\n3010 \u2013 Fund 101-Public Works \nSummary of Other Administered Budgets \nJames Bezek, Director of Resource Management \nPublic Ways \n \n \n \nI-8 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \n \nA summary of the budgets administered by the Public Works Division is provided on the following pages.\nDETAIL BY REVENUE\n2024/25\nFROM\nAND APPROPRIATION\n 2023/24\n ADOPTED\n 2025/26\n ADOPTED TO\nPERCENT\nOTHER ADMINISTERED BUDGETS\n ACTUAL\n BUDGET\n RECOMMENDED\n RECOMMENDED\nCHANGE\nREVENUES\n3030 REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PROJ\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.0%\n3020 PUBLIC WORKS IMPROVEMENT\n695,925\n652,312\n600,000\n(52,312)\n (8.0%)\nAPPROPRIATIONS\n3030 REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PROJ\n23,794\n0\n0\n0\n0.0%\n3020 PUBLIC WORKS IMPROVEMENT\n4,050\n2,500,000\n1,500,000\n(1,000,000)\n (40.0%)\nNET CHANGE\n3030 REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PROJ\n23,794\n0\n0\n0\n0.0%\n3020 PUBLIC WORKS IMPROVEMENT\n(691,875)\n1,847,688\n900,000\n(947,688)\n (51.3%)",

Regional transportation projects typically consist of \nlocal roads that provide major points of access to the State highway system or provide regional connections between communities \nand key transportation facilities and are typically coordinated with the Solano Transportation Authority (STA). \nIn FY2006/07, the Board approved a loan of up to $3 million from the General Fund to support regional transportation projects, \nwith the goal of repaying the loan with future transportation impact fees. The current principal loan balance outstanding as of June \n30, 2025 is $384,098. \nOn December 3, 2013, the Board adopted a resolution as part of the County Public Facilities Fee (PFF) update which included a \ntransportation fee component. This fee was established to address the impact of growth on the county regional road system. The \ntransportation fee has two parts: the first part of the fee, Part A, is designed to generate fair-share funding from new development \nto recover County debt service obligations on the Vanden Road segment of the Jepson Parkway and Suisun Parkway in the \nunincorporated area. The second part, Part B, is the Regional Transportation Impact Fee (RTIF), which was included at the request \nof the Solano Transportation Authority (STA) in consultation with the STA\u2019s RTIF Policy Committee, composed of the seven City \nManagers, the Mayors, County Administrator, and one County Supervisor. \nThe County is in the process of completing a 5-year Public Facilities Fee update which will go to the Board in FY2025/26. Based \non the update, the County will likely continue to receive approximately 5% of all RTIF fee revenue for County road projects.

Property owners who make an application to develop their property, such as a subdivision or building \npermit, are required in some locations to pay for road improvements. The payments are placed in this fund as a holding account \nuntil the road improvements are made, at which time the funds are used to reimburse the actual cost of the work performed. The \nimprovements are restricted to the area where the property development occurred. The largest sources of such payments are \nthe English Hills Zone of Benefit, Green Valley Zone of Benefit, and the Recology Hay Road, Road Damage Agreement. The \nwork is performed by Public Works Division employees on a reimbursable basis. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents a decrease of $52,312 or 8.0% in revenues and a decrease of $1,000,000 or 40.0% in \nappropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. As a result, the net fund cost decreased by $947,688 and the \nPublic Works Improvement Fund Balance decreased by $900,000. \nPrimary Funding Sources \nFunding sources include $550,000 in impact fees from the Recology Road Damage Agreement; English Hills and Middle Green \nValley road impact fees, reflecting a decrease of $25,000 or 4.3%; and $50,000 in interest income, a decrease of $27,312 or \n35.3%. \nPrimary Costs \nThe primary costs include reimbursements of $1,500,000 for Lewis Road construction project. \nFixed Assets \nNone. \nSee related Budget Unit 9122 - Fund 278 Contingencies (refer to Contingencies section of the Budget). \n \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS \n \nNone. \nSUMMARY OF POSITION CHANGES \nThere are no positions allocated to this budget. \nPENDING ISSUES AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS \nThere are no pending issues or policy considerations at this time. \nDETAIL BY REVENUE\nCATEGORY AND\nAPPROPRIATION CATEGORY\n2023/24\n ACTUAL\n2024/25 \nADOPTED\nBUDGET\n2025/26\nRECOMMENDED\nFROM\nADOPTED TO\nRECOMMENDED\nPERCENT\nCHANGE\nREVENUES\nREVENUE FROM USE OF MONEY/PROP\n101,971\n77,312\n50,000\n(27,312)\n(35.3%)\nCHARGES FOR SERVICES\n568,626\n575,000\n550,000\n(25,000)\n(4.3%)\nMISC REVENUE\n25,328\n0\n0\n0\n0.0%\nTOTAL REVENUES\n695,925\n652,312\n600,000\n(52,312)\n(8.0%)\nAPPROPRIATIONS\nOTHER FINANCING USES\n4,050\n2,500,000\n1,500,000\n(1,000,000)\n(40.0%)\nTOTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n4,050\n2,500,000\n1,500,000\n(1,000,000)\n(40.0%)\nNET CHANGE\n(691,876)\n1,847,688\n900,000\n(947,688)\n(51.3%)",

The County General Fund Contribution of $45.3 million represents 8.6% \nof H&SS funding and includes the required local (County) maintenance of effort (MOE) for several State and federal program \nareas. \nProgram Revenue \nProgram revenues are earned primarily by two methods. The first method is through reimbursement for actual costs from the State \nand federal government based upon time studies in which staff document hours worked in each program/activity, cost reports, or \nother methods of documenting actual program costs. The second method is through fee for service revenue as a result of billing \nvarious third-party payers, primarily Medi-Cal, on either a unit-of-service basis, a capitated payment, or a per-visit payment. \nCounty overhead and departmental administrative costs are distributed to all programs in H&SS and are included in each \nprogram\u2019s budget. The administrative costs include fixed operational expenses such as: utilities, Department of Information \nTechnology (DoIT), and Countywide Administrative Overhead charges that are incorporated into the department\u2019s federal/State \nclaims for cost reimbursement and are used in calculating H&SS billing rates paid by third parties. As a result, the majority of \nrevenues received by H&SS include reimbursement for both the direct costs associated with the individual employee providing \nspecific service as well as departmental administrative costs and direct charges from other County departments providing support \nDETAIL BY REVENUE\nAND APPROPRIATION\nFUNCTIONAL AREA\n2023/24\n ACTUAL\n2024/25 \nADOPTED\nBUDGET\n2025/26\nRECOMMENDED\nFROM\nADOPTED TO\nRECOMMENDED\nPERCENT\nCHANGE\nREVENUES\n ADMINISTRATION DIVISION\n6,966,959\n7,012,365\n6,891,451\n \n(120,914)\n(1.7%)\n BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIVISION\n141,590,447\n182,654,300\n182,151,770\n(502,530)\n(0.3%)\n SOCIAL SERVICES DIVISION\n145,679,798\n163,977,062\n167,116,704\n3,139,642\n1.9%\n IHSS - PA ADMINISTRATION\n831,575\n1,069,366\n1,011,305\n(58,061)\n(5.4%)\n PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS\n67,815,212\n72,359,754\n77,283,121\n4,923,367\n6.8%\n FAMILY HEALTH SERVICES DIVISION\n27,847,082\n37,550,172\n37,826,024\n275,852\n0.7%\n HEALTH SERVICES DIVISION\n54,309,107\n52,268,695\n50,273,877\n(1,994,818)\n(3.8%)\nTOTAL REVENUES\n445,040,180\n516,891,714\n522,554,252\n5,662,538\n1.1%\nAPPROPRIATIONS\n ADMINISTRATION DIVISION\n7,672,035\n7,012,365\n \n6,891,451\n(120,914)\n(1.7%)\n BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIVISION\n141,560,565\n183,218,883\n \n182,631,505\n(587,378)\n(0.3%)\n SOCIAL SERVICES DIVISION\n142,877,552\n163,977,062\n \n167,116,704\n3,139,642\n1.9%\n IHSS - PA ADMINISTRATION\n831,575\n1,069,366\n \n1,011,305\n(58,061)\n(5.4%)\n PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS\n67,449,691\n72,359,754\n \n77,283,121\n4,923,367\n6.8%\n FAMILY HEALTH SERVICES DIVISION\n31,284,228\n37,550,172\n37,826,024\n275,852\n0.7%\n HEALTH SERVICES DIVISION\n52,095,595\n59,592,051\n \n56,037,353\n(3,554,698)\n(6.0%)\nTOTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n443,771,241\n524,779,653\n528,797,463\n4,017,810\n0.8%\n \nNET CHANGE\n(1,268,939)\n7,887,939\n6,243,211\n(1,644,728)\n(20.9%)\nSTAFFING\n ADMINISTRATION DIVISION\n109.00\n111.00\n111.00\n0.00\n0.0%\n BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIVISION\n241.05\n253.55\n255.25\n1.70\n0.7%\n SOCIAL SERVICES DIVISION\n697.50\n727.50\n725.50\n(2.00)\n(0.3%)\n IHSS - PA ADMINISTRATION\n5.00\n4.00\n4.00\n0.00\n0.0%\n PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.0%\n FAMILY HEALTH SERVICES DIVISION\n158.40\n157.40\n157.40\n0.00\n0.0%\n HEALTH SERVICES DIVISION\n182.25\n179.25\n178.25\n(1.00)\n(0.6%)\nTOTAL STAFFING\n1,393.20\n1,432.70\n1,431.40\n(1.30)\n(0.1%)",

In FY2025/26, direct charges from other County departments plus Countywide Administrative Overhead total \n$38 million of which 91.4%, or approximately $34.7 million in federal, State and realignment funds are used to offset the County \nGeneral Fund costs for various County central service departments that provide services to H&SS programs. \nRealignment Revenue \nThe State Budget Act of 2011 included a major realignment of public safety programs from the State to local governments with \nthe majority of human services programs receiving State General Fund allocations realigned to counties. 2011 Realignment \nshifted the funding and program responsibility for Adoption Services, Foster Care, Child Welfare Services, Adult Protective \nServices, Substance Use, Early Periodic Screening Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT), and Managed Care from the State to \nlocal governments (county) and redirected specified tax revenues to fund this effort. The State share of funding for realigned \nprograms has been replaced by funding based on a percentage of realignment funds (State sales tax and vehicle license fees) \ncollected. However, the County still receives State allocations for a few programs that are matched 50% by federal funds, which \nincludes the administration of the CalFresh, Medi-Cal, and CalWORKs programs. Federal revenues are often matching funds for \nprograms where the State and local governments share costs; however, the federal portions are based upon the actual cost of \nproviding the service. Federal revenues included in the budget are developed using a number of factors: caseload; number of \nfilled positions each quarter; the cost for each position; overhead and other costs associated with each filled position; productivity \nrates; and interim, estimated or approved, reimbursement rates. \n1991 Realignment \n1991 Realignment, a dedicated percentage of State sales tax and VLF, is the second major funding source for H&SS. The \ndistribution of funds amongst counties is based upon formulas established in 1991. Funds are designated for specified human \nservices programs, mostly federal, which the State and the County have traditionally shared the \u201clocal\u201d costs to draw down federal \nmatching funds. In order to continue to receive 1991 Realignment funds, the County is obligated to fund the State share of \nprogram costs, and/or has a fixed maintenance of effort (MOE) amount. Regardless of actual 1991 Realignment revenues \nreceived, the County\u2019s share of costs for the realigned programs is a fixed percentage. \nSince realignment funds are generated by sales tax and VLF, the funding can fluctuate based on economic conditions; the amount \nof State collected and distributed revenues substantially declined from $46.2 million in FY2006/07 to $34 million in FY2009/10. \nHowever, since FY2011/12 these revenues have been slowly trending upward but continue to fall short of the increased costs \nassociated with providing mandated services. In FY2023/24, 1991 Realignment sales tax did not meet the base level of funding. \nThe FY2025/26 Recommended Budget includes $69.9 million in 1991 Realignment funds that will be drawn down and recognized \nas revenues. \n1991 Realignment funds are allocated to three main areas: \n\u2022 \nHealth Services \u2013 a portion of the Health Realignment funding (approximately $6.87 million) previously set aside for the \nCounty Medi-Cal Services Program (CMSP) for indigent health care is being redirected at the State level to fund Social \nServices programs. The balance is available to support uncompensated costs in the Family Health Services budget and to \nfund the realigned Public Health programs. \n\u2022 \nSocial Services \u2013 funds are dedicated for Child Welfare Services, Foster Care and IHSS programs. By statute, any growth \n(funding above the established base amount) in overall 1991 Realignment Revenue is first used to fund caseload growth for \nSocial Services statewide. \n\u2022 \nMental Health \u2013 funds are used to pay the 50% local share for services for adult Medi-Cal clients (the balance is reimbursed \nby federal funds) and for the full costs of services provided to indigents and other low-income clients. Under 2011 \nRealignment, and following the federal approval of the ACA (see glossary for definition) and State adoption of the Medi-Cal \nexpansion and Healthcare Exchange, the funds previously allocated to this account have been shifted to pay for the County\u2019s \nincreased share of costs for the CalWORKs assistance programs (approximately $4.4 million); however, the State is required \nto fully replace the 1991 Realignment funds shifted from Mental Health to CalWORKs and is responsible for any shortfall in \nfunding. \nA portion of the 1991 Realignment funds previously set aside for the County\u2019s obligation to pay for indigent health care (WIC \n\u00a717000) has been redirected at the State level to fund Social Services programs with enactment of Assembly Bill (AB) 85, January \n1, 2014, including increases in CalWORKs grants.

The enactment of AB \n85 provided the mechanism for redirecting these realignment funds. \nAB 85, effective January 2014, also changed the growth distribution within the three areas of 1991 Realignment. Specifically, \nSocial Services receives first call on growth in funds (to fund caseload growth) but no longer receives general growth. Health \nServices receives significantly less from general growth, from approximately 52% to 18.5%, while Mental Health remains the same \nat approximately 40%. \nAB 130 and Senate Bill (SB) 90 created a new County IHSS MOE, effective July 1, 2017. The State increased In-Home Supportive \nServices (IHSS) costs to counties partially by redirecting VLF growth from the Health, Mental Health, and CMSP accounts to \nSocial Services. Social Services received the sales tax growth due to the IHSS caseload increase resulting in Health and Mental \nHealth\u2019s sales tax bases being flat funded. Health and Mental Health lost funding of $613,283 in FY2017/18 and $509,458 in \nFY2018/19 as a result of the redirected growth funds. On July 1, 2019, SB 80 was enacted into law to create a more sustainable \nIHSS MOE structure which included rebasing counties\u2019 MOE to a lower amount, ceasing the redirection of VLF growth revenues, \nreducing the MOE inflation factor from 7% to 4%, and enacting changes to wage and benefit bargaining. \n2011 Realignment \nThe major portion of the 2011 Public Safety Realignment funding is dedicated to human service programs and substantially \nchanged how those programs are funded in California. H&SS estimates $82.4 million in 2011 Realignment funds for FY2025/26. \nThese funds are dedicated to Child Welfare Services, Foster Care, Mental Health, and Substance Use programs. Previously, \nunder the 1991 Realignment, counties were required to fund a certain percentage of the program costs; starting in 2011, counties \nare fully responsible for funding the non-federal share of these programs using the 2011 Realignment revenue. \nBoth realignment funding streams (1991 and 2011) are heavily dependent upon economic conditions since the source is sales tax \nand VLF. During periods of economic downturn, funding declines while demand for human services programs increases. The \nincreased risk of revenue loss during periods of peak demand requires H&SS to monitor cash receipts, project future revenues \nbased on economic indicators, track service level demand, and develop cost-effective service delivery systems. \nCounty General Fund Contribution \nThe Recommended Budget includes a County General Fund Contribution in the amount of $45,273,089, a decrease of $863,631 \nor 1.9% when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. The above amount excludes $159,451 in additional transfers to H&SS \n\u2013 Administration representing the General Fund Contribution to Non-County Agencies contracted through H&SS. \nThe decrease is comprised of the following: \n\u2022 \n$800,000 increase in Behavioral Health to fund program operations in lieu of 1991 Realignment due to slower growth projected \nfor 1991 Realignment and costs outpacing the growth. \n\u2022 \n$1,176,928 increase in Social Services primarily due to an increase in spending in the administration of various programs \nresulting from overall increase in costs and increases in other countywide and departmental administration costs. \n\u2022 \n$732,856 decrease primarily representing decrease in Public Guardian and General Assistance program administration costs. \n\u2022 \n$127,570 decrease in Assistance primarily due to decrease in General Assistance program costs. \n\u2022 \nDecrease of $4,708,209 in ARPA-SLFRF one-time funds which partially funded the ongoing structural deficit within the clinics \nin FY2024/25. \n\u2022 \nIncrease of $2,500,000 in County General Fund to support clinic operations. \n\u2022 \n$126,614 increase to support various County General Fund funded programs and initiatives. \n\u2022 \n$101,462 increase in non-claimable costs. \nThe County General Fund Contribution of $45,273,089 is appropriated with $4,337,626 funding the Assistance Programs, and \n$40,935,463 funding the following operations in H&SS: \n\u2022 \n$16,363,365 in mandatory match or County share of costs for federal/State programs for Child Welfare Services, CalSAWS, \nand administration of CalWORKs, CalFresh, Medi-Cal and IHSS programs (see glossary for definitions).

Integration of these funding sources and programs allows the \nDepartment of Health and Social Services (H&SS), Behavioral Health Division to efficiently monitor and manage programs and \nexpenses as a comprehensive behavioral health system of care. \nFUNCTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES \nThe Behavioral Health Division provides specialty mental health services (SMHS) in accordance with Title 9, California Code of \nRegulations, sections 1820.205, 1830.205, and 1830.210. Substance Use Disorder services are delivered under the authority of \nTitle 45, Code of Federal Regulations and California Health and Safety Code \u00a711750-\u00a711997. Behavioral Health provides \nintegrated co-occurring care (Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder) for those who meet medical necessity for services \nunder the MHP. Annually, Behavioral Health receives Mental Health Block Grant (MHBG) and Projects for Assistance in Transition \nfrom Homelessness (PATH) funding through the federal government under the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Behavioral Health also receives various other State \ngrants to support special populations and initiatives. \nSubstance Use Disorder services are provided, since July 2020, through a contract with Partnership HealthPlan of California \n(PHC) under the Organized Delivery System (ODS) State waiver for Drug Medi-Cal (DMC) services, as well as services for those \nthat do not have Medi-Cal under the Substance Abuse Block Grant (SABG) through SAMHSA. \nThe Behavioral Health Division provides a continuum of care across all ages for individuals who qualify for specialty mental health \nservices, which include individuals with moderate to high mental health disorders, as defined under the Medi-Cal Mental Health \nPlan, and the indigent and uninsured. Federal law requires that service must be provided in the least restrictive setting, appropriate \nto individualized needs. The County operates as a managed care plan under contract with the State Department of Health Care \nServices (DHCS), providing both direct services and contracting with community-based providers to provide services. The \nBehavioral Health Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement Unit oversees compliance with the contractual obligations \nassociated with the MHP as well as quality of care. Services are primarily funded by Medi-Cal, which has federal, State, and local \nfunding components. The Mental Health Services Act \u2013 Proposition 63 (MHSA) provides a funding structure designed to expand \nand transform the mental health system beyond those services traditionally billed to Medi-Cal. In March 2024, the voters approved \nProposition 1 which changes the MHSA to the Behavioral Health Services Act (BHSA), decreases county funding from 91% to \n85.5% of total BHSA revenues and changes how the funding may be used. See the Pending Issues section below for additional \ninformation. \nSpecialty mental health service provisions within the mental health programs of the Behavioral Health Division include: \n\u2022 \nA 24-hour toll-free access line to obtain mental health care operated by a team of County licensed clinicians during the day \nand the Crisis Stabilization Unit after hours. Access staff screen callers for both mental health and substance use needs and \neligibility and offer connection to the right place for assessment and ongoing treatment. \n\u2022 \nMobile crisis services provide rapid response, individual assessment and community-based stabilization to Medi-Cal \nbeneficiaries who are experiencing a behavioral health crisis through de-escalation and stabilization techniques to reduce the \nimmediate risk of danger and subsequent harm, and to avoid unnecessary emergency department care, psychiatric inpatient \nhospitalizations, and law enforcement involvement. \n\u2022 \nRecovery oriented treatment, rehabilitation, and community support services to children and youth with serious emotional \ndisorders and adults with serious mental illnesses. Youth and adults are served through County outpatient clinics in Vallejo, \nFairfield, and Vacaville, as well as through community-based organizations located in all the cities. \n\u2022 \nA contracted network augments the County\u2019s outpatient capacity and includes adult case management, Full Service \nPartnership (FSP) and specialized services for youth such as the 0-5 programs, counseling for youth at school sites, and \ntherapeutic behavioral services (TBS) which is an intensive behavior-focused program for youth and families.",

Counties are now required to report standardized \nHealthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures annually. For measurement year 2023, Solano County \nmet State minimums with rates of 52% for Antidepressant Medication Management (AMM), 71.4% for psychosocial care \n(APP), 77% for hospital follow-up (FUH), 70% for ER follow-up (FUM), and 70% for antipsychotic medication adherence \n(SAA). \n\u2022 \nCalAIM includes a requirement to standardize specialty mental health services (SMHS) for all counties and resulted in current \nKaiser Medi-Cal specialty mental health services\u2019 clients transitioning to County Behavioral Health caseload in 2024. The \ntransition occurred in two phases: Phase 1 (July\u2013December 2024) involved transferring 57 existing Kaiser clients\u201440 adults \n(including 5 in Full Service Partnership programs), 2 Transitional Age Youth (TAY), and 15 children\u2014to Solano County \nBehavioral Health. Phase 2 began on January 1, 2025, with Behavioral Health becoming the direct provider for all new eligible \nKaiser members requiring SMHS. Since July 2024, Behavioral Health\u2019s Access line received 379 calls from Kaiser \nbeneficiaries, resulting in 171 adult and 86 youth mental health referrals, and 122 substance use disorder (SUD) treatment \nreferrals through Partnership HealthPlan. The State considers the transition complete, and Behavioral Health is now regularly \naccepting new Kaiser-referred SMHS clients. \n\u2022 \nSubstance use and mental health integration is a key focus of the Opioid Settlement Fund and CalAIM, which requires full \nintegration by 2027. Behavioral Health has implemented a co-occurring integrated model for care Data from 2024 showed \nthat out of 3,560 adult mental health clients, 28% had co-occurring substance use disorders, which often affects their ability \nto fully engage in mental health treatment. In 2024, overdose deaths dropped from 115 in 2023 to 90 in 2024, underscoring \nthe need for integrated services. \n\u2022 \nCommunity Assistance, Recovery and Empowerment (CARE) Court was implemented in Solano County on December 1, \n2024. The program is designed to provide support and treatment for individuals with diagnoses on the psychotic spectrum \nwho are at risk of homelessness or incarceration. The purpose is to connect individuals with treatment by using a civil court \nprocess. \n\uf0a7 \nIn the Fall of 2023, Solano County Behavioral Health received a provisional award of $1,191,233 from the Department of \nHealth Care Services (DHCS) under the Providing Access and Transforming Health (PATH) Justice-Involved Capacity \nBuilding Round 3 grant program to support collaborative planning with the Sheriff\u2019s Office on behavioral health service linkage \nfor individuals with mental health and substance use disorder challenges being released from the jails. As a result of federal \napproval under CalAIM and AB 133 (establishes a mandate for data sharing), this grant supports the initiation of pre-release \nand reentry services in the 90 days prior to an individual\u2019s release into the community. Between October and December \n2024, the PATH team received a total of 84 referrals. Of those 84 referrals, the team served a total of two clients, 33 still \nremain in custody and a total of 51 were released into the community. \n\u2022 \nSolano County\u2019s Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT) initiative, or Laura\u2019s Law, began in Solano County in 2019 as a new \nintervention strategy adopted by the Solano County Board of Supervisors for local implementation. AOT is a civil (not criminal) \nlegal procedure that can be requested by concerned family members, caregivers, and other qualified referral sources for \npeople who may be too ill to recognize the need for services. In 2024, Solano County received 17 unduplicated referrals, zero \nreferrals were court-ordered to the Department of State Hospitals (DSH), one was supported through treatment linkage and \ntreatment re-engagement, seven were ineligible referrals, one individual was unable to be located, and eight continue to be \nactive referrals the team is working to engage and link to services.",

The DCT program provided intensive services to people on mental health diversion. Services \nincluded intensive case management, housing subsidies, vocational rehabilitation, therapy, individual rehabilitation, \ncoordination with mental health court, and linkage to supports. The program served 21 individuals in 2024. Of the 21 clients, \ntwo completed the program, seven were discharged (absent without leave, declined services, did not engage in services, or \nopted out of treatment). There are 14 remaining clients being served in the program. \n\u2022 \nCrisis Intervention Team (CIT) training for law enforcement and first responders started in October 2022. To date, 78 officers \nand 2 first responders have completed the program. The training provides law enforcement with information on various \ndiagnoses and includes panels and presentations from people and families with lived experience, a hearing voices simulation \nexercise, de-escalation techniques, suicide prevention, cultural humility, vicarious trauma, and self-care for officers, as well \nas an overview of the array of services and resources available through Behavioral Health. The goal is to increase the number \nof trained CIT officers throughout the county with crisis intervention strategies and techniques to address a mental health \ncrisis, and coordinate with mobile crisis teams. \n\u2022 \nMobile Crisis Services: \n\uf0a7 \nAs of April 15, 2024, mobile crisis is available 24/7, 365 days/year. A community number was launched on May 15, 2024, \nas part of Mental Health Awareness Month through a marketing campaign with social media, video, television, and radio \nads, bus wraps, and posters throughout the community. Mobile Crisis became a Medi-Cal entitlement as of January 2023 \nand counties had until December 2023 to become fully operational (with new requirements). Behavioral Health has been \napproved by the State to bill at the new enhanced rate for mobile crisis services. For 2024, the Mobile Crisis Team \nresponded to 945 callers. Of these callers, 71% were stabilized in the community and thus diverted from emergency \nrooms, jails, and hospitals; others utilized Crisis Stabilization Unit services. \n\uf0a7 \nSchool based mobile crisis was implemented on July 27, 2021, with the Solano County Office of Education (SCOE) \nutilizing Mental Health Student Services Act (MHSSA) grant funds. SCOE serves all students, regardless of insurance or \nimmigration status, with the mission of de-escalating situations, linking families to necessary services, and supporting \nthe coordination of care. In 2024, 221 students were served, 56 (25%) were placed on an involuntary hold and 75% \nresponded to de-escalation intervention and safety planning. SCOE was approved to bill for the new enhanced rate for \ncrisis services. \n\u2022 \nCrisis Aftercare and Recovery Engagement (CARE) team offers direct support to clients utilizing services at Solano County \nemergency departments, crisis stabilization unit (CSU), mobile crisis, and the crisis residential treatment program. The CARE \nteam assesses the medical necessity of each client to determine the appropriate level of care and support. When clients are \ndischarged from psychiatric facilities, the CARE team helps facilitate a smooth transition by assessing their needs and \ncoordinating referrals for further care. Additionally, the team provides vital linkage to community resources, aiming to reduce \nthe risk of re-hospitalization and promote ongoing recovery. In 2024, the CARE Team served 275 unduplicated clients. \n\u2022 \nThe role of the hospital liaison team is to facilitate the coordination of hospital treatment and discharge planning by working \nclosely with psychiatric inpatient hospitals, other county clinics, and community partners to ensure the proper level of client \ncare. In 2024, the Hospital Liaison team served 569 unduplicated adult and 89 unduplicated youth clients. \n\u2022 \nThe Homeless Outreach Partnership and Engagement (HOPE) team is a multidisciplinary street medicine program delivering \nbehavioral health and support services to individuals experiencing homelessness. Established in 2019, the team initially \nfocused on broad outreach, connecting with over 150 individuals annually. However, high demand limits the depth of care \nthey could provide. In 2024, HOPE implemented critical time intervention (CTI), an evidence-based, time-limited case \nmanagement model aimed at supporting individuals during key transitions like moving into housing. This shift allowed the \nteam to focus on a smaller caseload, serving 54 individuals with more intensive, personalized care. The new approach \nemphasizes quality over quantity, strengthening client relationships and supporting long-term stability. \n\u2022 \nIn 2024, Behavioral Health selected Abode Services as its new housing and homeless services provider to manage six key \nprograms: permanent supportive housing (PSH), street outreach, forensic respite, housing navigation, landlord engagement \n(LLE) and subsidy administration, and rapid re-housing (RRH). These programs rolled out in phases, beginning with PSH in \nJanuary, which supported 23 households at Blue Oak Landing (No Place Like Home, Vallejo) and is set to expand with an \nadditional 45 households transitioning from Caminar, Inc. by January 2025. Street outreach launched in April, followed by \nforensic respite and housing navigation in May, LLE in June, and RRH in August. Since launch, Abode has streamlined",

This funding is also being used to support \npermanent supportive housing services at Blue Oak Landing and Fair Haven Commons. \n\uf0a7 \nHHAP Round 4 allocation award of $1,470,396 expires December 31, 2027. This allocation provides funding to expand \npermanent supportive housing services and rapid re-housing programs operated by Abode Services, serving 125 \npermanent supportive housing residents and 50 rapid re-housing households. \n\uf0a7 \nHHAP Round 5 grant application was coordinated with the Community Action Partnership Solano (CAP Solano). \nBehavioral Health will be receiving $1,655,549 in HHAP Round 5 funding which will be used to maintain and strengthen \nhousing supports and resources that Behavioral Health initially established through one-time grants that are now \napproaching expiration. HHAP Round 5 funding will help sustain critical services and ensure continued tenancy support \nfor individuals with mental health needs through June 30, 2029. \n\uf0a7 \nBehavioral Health received a noncompetitive allocation of $8,352,207 in Behavioral Health Bridge Housing (BHBH) \nprogram funding. The BHBH program was signed into law in September 2022 under AB 179 (Ting, Chapter 249, Statutes \nof 2022), and provides funding through June 30, 2027. The funding supports a variety of programs provided through a \ncontract with Abode. Abode provides bridge housing settings to address the immediate and sustainable housing needs \nof people experiencing homelessness who have serious behavioral health conditions, including a serious mental illness \n(SMI) and/or substance use disorder (SUD). These funds are connected to the CARE Act to support enhancements of \ndifferent types of housing to support CARE Court recipients and others. \n\uf0a7 \nOther critical funding sources include $1,366,292 from the Substance Use Block Grant (SUBG) and $46,216.00 from the \nMental Health Block Grant (MHBG), both allocated in 2024 for rental subsidies for individuals with co-occurring substance \nuse and mental health conditions, as well as $68,199 from the PATH grant to fund HOPE staff conducting homeless \noutreach in 2024. \n\u2022 \nIn 2024, the Housing and Homelessness unit expanded its shared-housing network, which includes 35 board and care homes, \n20 room and board homes, and 28 sober living environments. Originally launched in 2017, the network has grown with the \naddition of formal onboarding and evaluation process to ensure quality, ethical housing for Behavioral Health clients. To \nsupport landlords, Community Integration Services (CIS) provides onsite coaching, hosts quarterly provider meetings (eight \nin 2024), follows up on incidents, and ensures fair rental rates across all homes. \n\u2022 \nThe Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) is a federally mandated tool for tracking and coordinating homeless \nservices. In 2024, Solano County transitioned from the outdated HMIS system to a more user-friendly and robust application, \nwhich enhances data entry, reporting, and coordination. A significant achievement for Behavioral Health was integrating \ncontracted housing providers into HMIS, filling a crucial gap in the local homeless services system. This integration began in \nJuly 2024, allowing housing programs to be visible to other service providers, improving coordination and data sharing. In \n2025, CIS plans to expand the use of HMIS to include supportive services data, further improving care continuity and decision-\nmaking in Solano County. \n\u2022 \nIn 2024, Behavioral Health maintained 71 contracted beds across its transitional and shelter housing programs and \nimplemented key improvements to expand services. Laurel Creek and Gateway, operated by Caminar, were merged and \nredesigned to extend the stay from 90 to 120 days, offering a more structured, two-phase program. Clients begin with 90 days",

The program was \nreclassified as shelter housing, helping clients retain their \u201chomeless\u201d status for eligibility under the U.S. Department of \nHousing and Urban Development (HUD). Behavioral Health also expanded Opportunity House\u2019s (a shelter in Vacaville) scope \nto include clients with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders. Additionally, Shelter Solano\u2019s (located in \nFairfield) contracted beds increased from 15 to 25, boosting shelter capacity. \n\u2022 \nH&SS was awarded $2,851,239 from the State Department of Social Services for the Community Care Expansion (CCE) \nPreservation program, aimed at supporting licensed care facilities, or \"board and care\" homes. Behavioral Health administers \nthe program, with funding used for capital improvements and ongoing operating subsidies. A third-party consultant, Thurmond \nConsulting, was hired to help manage the funds. Through a competitive request for proposal (RFP) process, 14 board and \ncare homes were selected to receive support. As of now, 72% of the funds have been committed, with the remainder reserved \nfor additional awards and contingencies. \n\u2022 \nThe behavioral medical coordination team is continuing with innovative efforts to meet the need of the expanding population \nof youth and adults with eating disorders. With the introduction of Kaiser as a Medi-Cal managed care provider there is an \nincreasing need for care coordination to ensure proper care is administered. In 2025, the behavioral medical coordination \nteam plans to continue streamlining the standardization of their screening and assessment process as well as innovating how \ncare is documented throughout the system. The team hopes to continue to partner with other agencies to conduct more \ntraining and outreach to ensure that eating disorder cases are identified and provided the opportunity to obtain equitable \naccess to treatment. \n\u2022 \nThe expanded Internship Program offers workforce development opportunities for master\u2019s students in counseling, social \nwork, and doctoral interns in psychology, providing stipends for those serving underserved communities in Solano County. \nInterns are placed in county programs with clinical supervision. The program prioritizes bilingual/bicultural recruitment and \nbuilds partnerships with higher learning institutions to create a culturally competent workforce. In 2024, the program received \nthe California State Association of Counties (CSAC) award for its innovative hiring practices and had 13 interns. It is now fully \naccredited by the Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers (APPIC) and participates in a mentorship \nprogram. The psychology program is hosting its second cohort, and three new psychologist positions have been filled by \nentry-level psychologists, including two former interns and one bilingual postdoctoral associate. \nSubstance Use Disorders \n\u2022 \nServices continue to be expanded through the Organized Delivery System (ODS) Drug Medi-Cal (DMC) waiver through \nPartnership HealthPlan of California (PHC) under the seven county regional model, which includes prevention, intervention, \ntreatment, and recovery services for substance use for youth and adults, including probationers and parolees; residential \ntreatment for adults, with preferential placement given to pregnant and postpartum women and IV drug users; withdrawal \nmanagement, or detox; Medication Assisted Treatment, and recovery supports. In 2025, Behavioral Health worked with PHC \nto add a new provider focused on serving youth substance use treatment. \n\u2022 \nBehavioral Health is coordinating efforts with the Public Health Division\u2019s prevention team and Drug Safe Solano, the county \nopioid coalition, to administer funds received through opioid settlement judgements. Key initiatives include a Mobile Harm \nReduction Program to improve access to syringe exchange and opioid use disorder (OUD) support, and a Youth Outreach \nProgram. These efforts foster partnerships with local organizations to enhance education, community access, and support \nfor SUD/OUD prevention and recovery. \nMental Health Services Act \n\u2022 \nThe Full Service Partnership (FSP) programs continue to provide the most intensive outpatient level of care with services \nprovided to consumers 2-3 times per week, and more often as necessary. The adult FSPs continue to implement Assertive \nCommunity Treatment (ACT), an evidenced-based practice (EBP) model, and the child/youth FSP teams continue to \nimplement the Transitions to Independence Process (TIP) EBP to engage and support young people experiencing emotional \nand/or behavioral struggles. \n\u2022 \nThe Employment Services and Support program uses the Individual Placement and Support (IPS) (EBP) model to help people \nget jobs in the community. In 2024, IPS served 140 consumers, of which 24% (33) were youth under the age of 25 years, and \n47% (66) of the consumers secured competitive employment and 31% (43) maintained employment for at least 90 days.",

Davis Behavioral Health Center of Excellence. This app allows consumers and family \nmembers to self-report on progress in care and will assist in treatment planning with consumers and allow EP programs to \nlearn from each other with a goal to develop a national network to improve care for individuals with early psychosis. This \nproject ended June 2024; however, U.C. Davis Behavioral Health Center of Excellence continues to support the app and data \nreporting. \n\u2022 \nSolano County Behavioral Health collaborated with the Solano County Public Health Division and local hospitals in a new \nPrevention and Early Intervention (PEI) data tracking project which monitors timely access to completed suicides and suicide \nattempt data. Public Health accesses aggregated emergency room data through a no-cost, cloud-based platform called \nBioSense. Memorandums of understanding were developed with three local hospital systems to compile contact information \nfor next of kin and survivors of suicide attempt in order to offer support services and/or referrals. This effort was supplemented \nwith grant funding from the California Department of Public Health. \n\u2022 \nSolano County Behavioral Health selected two new prevention and early intervention vendors through a request for proposal \n(RFP) process to address mental health needs and promote stigma and discrimination reduction within African \nAmerican/Black, Asian American Pacific Islander, Latino/Hispanic, and Native American/Indigenous communities. The first \nvendor will conduct at least 16 culturally specific workshops for a minimum of 320 community members and will offer six eight-\nweek open forum support groups and healing circles, reaching at least 240 participants. The second vendor will organize at \nleast eight culturally specific stigma reduction community events for a minimum of 800 attendees, along with eight virtual \nevents or webinars aimed at engaging at least 400 participants from the targeted communities. \n\u2022 \nIn 2024, MHSA funding was partially utilized to expand permanent supportive housing services to referred residents living in \n44 units at an affordable housing community in Solano County. The referred applicants/residents qualified for housing and \nservices as individuals or families with serious mental disorders and/or serious emotional disturbance. Supported housing \nservices offered include, but are not limited to, benefits counseling, referrals to co-occurring treatment resources, linkages and \ncoordination with primary care and medical providers to routine and preventative care and medication management, referral \nto mental health services, referral to substance use/abuse services, and referrals to employment/vocational/educational \ntraining and opportunities. \n\u2022 \nUnder the Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) component, Behavioral Health continues to lead an effort to train community \nmembers in a new model to support mental health and suicide prevention. Four culturally responsive workshops were held \nusing the Be Sensitive Be Brave (BSBB) curriculum, which infuses culture and diversity. Twenty-eight participants completed \nthe training. The mental health workshops prepare individuals to help friends and loved ones during times of distress and how \nto recognize mental health conditions, what to do when someone needs support, and tools for maintaining good mental health. \nThe suicide prevention workshops teach individuals to act as eyes and ears for suicidal distress and to connect individuals to \nhelp by identifying signs of suicide. \n\u2022 \nCounty and community-based organization programs continue to experience staffing recruitment and retention challenges \nimpacting the capacity of the system to manage new requests for services and providing services based on the level of care \nneed for individual consumers. \nWORKLOAD INDICATORS \nThe following workload indicators cover calendar year 2024: \n\u2022 \nBehavioral Health provided mental health services to approximately 6,586 severely mentally ill adults and youth through \ncounty programs, contract programs and the Managed Care Provider Network, a 12% increase over CY2023. The county \nadult outpatient clinic served 3,560 adults, a 3% increase from 2023. Programs served 1,473 youth, with many served in both \ncontract programs and county programs, as youth often receive case management and therapy services from a contractor \nand their psychiatric medication services, if needed, from a county provider. \n\u2022 \nIn 2024, 1,544 members were served and a total of approximately 152,000 services rendered. Of the members who accessed \nservices, 831 accessed more than one level of care. Service linkage continues through referral to the Carelon (formerly known",

Information related to the Three-Year \nProgram and Expenditure Plan is included under BU 7780 \u2013 Fund 902. In 2024, Behavioral Health held the required (CPP) \nmeetings with 138 unduplicated attendees and included a presentation on the history and components of MHSA, the role of \nthe community in the CPP process, State and local MHSA updates, and data related to MHSA funded programs and services \nrendered in FY2023/24. A 30-day public comment period was held and on June 18, 2024, a virtual public hearing was held in \npartnership with the Solano County Mental Health Advisory Board. On August 13, 2024, the Board approved the MHSA \nThree-Year Plan. The approved plan was then submitted to BHSOAC and DHCS on September 23, 2024. \nThe following data indicates services rendered in FY2023/24 by MHSA component: \n\u2022 \nPrevention and Early Intervention (PEI): 24% of the total MHSA funds received annually are allocated to PEI to provide \nsupport to prevent individuals (with 51% of the funds supporting individuals 25 years of age or younger) from developing \nmental health conditions and/or to serve those with mild-to-moderate mental health conditions and countywide stigma and \nsuicide prevention efforts. \n\uf0a7 \n11,726 people were served across various programs including mobile crisis and school-based services. \n\u2022 \nCommunity Services and Supports (CSS): 68% of the total MHSA funds received annually are allocated to CSS for services \nto individuals of all ages with more serious mental health conditions. \n\uf0a7 \n1,696 clients were served in high intensity programs including FSP, forensics, and others. \n\uf0a7 \n$4.0 million or 14.8% of the CSS funds provided supported housing services. \n\u2022 \nInnovation (INN): 5% of the total MHSA funds received annually are allocated to INN for increasing access to quality mental \nhealth services to underserved or underrepresented communities with measured outcomes and promote interagency and \ncommunity collaboration related to mental health services, supports, or outcomes. Behavioral Health is not currently working \non an innovative plan. \n\u2022 \nWorkforce Education and Training (WET): this component has not received an allocation since 2014; however, funds from \nthe CSS component may be transferred to this component to fund programs designed to enhance the public mental health \nworkforce, including training on evidence-based practices, stipends for interns, and retention programs for hard to fill positions. \n\uf0a7 \nSupported over 15 workforce and community trainings, including trainings on evidence-based practices. \n\uf0a7 \nSupported the Internship Program, including post-graduate and master\u2019s level psychology interns and a loan-repayment \nprogram. \n\u2022 \nCapital Facilities and Technological Needs (CF/TN): this component has not received an allocation since 2014; however, \nfunds from the CSS component may be transferred to this component.

Federal revenue provides 50% reimbursement for \nadult mental health and Drug Medi-Cal services provided to traditional Medi-Cal recipients. Children\u2019s mental health services are \nalso primarily reimbursed at 50%. For the Medi-Cal recipients that became eligible under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the \nfederal reimbursement is 90%. To ensure that counties receive 100% reimbursement for the ACA population, State General Fund \nprovides the 10% difference. In addition to federal Drug Medi-Cal revenues, services that are not Medi-Cal billable are funded with \na federal Substance Use Block Grant (SUBG) (previously referred to as Substance Abuse Block Grant or SABG). \nBilling for Mental Health Medi-Cal services changed on July 1, 2023 (\u201cpayment reform\u201d) from a cost per unit basis to a service rate \nbased on Current Procedure Terminology (CPT) and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) by provider type. \nPreviously, county interim rates were claimed to DHCS and cost settled to actual costs through a lengthy cost settlement process. \nUnder the new system, reimbursement is driven by direct service provision and not cost settled. Counties bear more fiscal risk as \nthey will be responsible for managing the behavioral health system with revenues generated through direct service billing. Another \nmajor change under payment reform is how counties will receive Medi-Cal reimbursement. Medi-Cal revenues are now received \nthrough an Intergovernmental Transfer (IGT) process with DHCS. Counties will be responsible for providing the non-federal share \nfunding to DHCS so that DHCS can then claim the services to the federal government and, once reimbursed, return both the \nnonfederal and federal share to the counties. H&SS continues to troubleshoot claiming issues in implementing payment reform \nand reimbursement has been delayed, impacting cash flow. \nThe Drug Medi-Cal Organized Delivery System (DMC-ODS) was implemented July 1, 2020. Partnership HealthPlan administers \nthe Drug Medi-Cal services on behalf of the County. The County pays Partnership HealthPlan an interim per utilizer per month \nrate. Federal and State reimbursement is provided after the County pays Partnership HealthPlan. An annual reconciliation process \nto actual allowable costs between the County, Partnership HealthPlan, and the Department of Healthcare Services (DHCS) is \nsupposed to occur; however, the reconciliations for FY2020/21, FY2021/22, FY2022/23, and FY2023/24 are still pending. H&SS \nrecently discovered that it has been overpaid for several months due to duplicate services processed. H&SS is working with DHCS \nand PHP to correct; however, the amount of overpayment is unclear. \nMHSA is the primary State funding source for mental health services. MHSA funding provides cost reimbursement for mental \nhealth community support services, prevention and early intervention, and mental health workforce education. MHSA funding also \nprovides the non-federal match for MHSA programs that include Medi-Cal billable services. \n1991 and 2011 Realignment are the other significant funding sources for Behavioral Health. Counties receive a guaranteed \namount of 1991 Realignment for Mental Health. In addition, counties may receive additional revenue after the guaranteed amount \nstatewide is met. Once the guarantee is met, funding is distributed up to an established base amount. If funding exceeds the base, \ngrowth is distributed and added to the base in the next fiscal year. \nIn 2011, State General Funds for children\u2019s mental health services, substance abuse treatment services, drug court activities, and \nsubstance abuse Drug Medi-Cal (DMC) were realigned to the County. Proposition 30 constitutionally protected this funding in \n2012. H&SS receives an established percentage of the State\u2019s determined base amount for 2011 Realignment yearly. Any growth \nabove the State\u2019s base amount is distributed among counties. Growth is added to the base to establish a new base for the next \nfiscal year. \n2011 and 1991 Realignment are principal funding sources for core services and the primary non-federal match for Medi-Cal along \nwith MHSA funding. Realignment funding, however, is subject to fluctuations based on economic conditions because it is primarily \nbased on the State\u2019s sales tax revenues. Concerns remain that the cost of realigned programs will continue to be outpaced by the \ngrowth in sales tax revenues. \nMental Health also receives County General Fund to support program operations; historically funding Drug Medi-Cal nonfederal \nmatch, adult outpatient services, indigent inpatient stays, Institutes for Mental Disease (IMDs), Augmented Board and Care (ABC) \ncosts. Due to slower growth projected for 1991 Realignment and costs outpacing the growth, the department assessed the use \nof 1991 Realignment and identified areas where other revenues could be used in lieu of 1991 Realignment. As a result, County \nGeneral Fund was redistributed within the Behavioral Health Division. For FY2025/26, County General Fund is being used for \nindigent inpatient stays, Institutes for Mental Disease (IMDs), Augmented Board and Care (ABC) costs and for increases in \nretirement and health benefit costs while maintaining any required maintenance of efforts.",

These positions support the Behavioral Health \ninternship program (approved by the Board on January 10, 2023) where incumbents receive training and hours, a prerequisite \nfor moving into regular Clinical Psychologist positions, and a requirement for accreditation with the American Psychological \nAssociation. The positions are funded with federal, State and MHSA revenues. \nThe FY2025/26 Recommended Budget includes the following position allocation changes: \n\u2022 \nAdd 0.5 FTE Office Assistant II to increase a 0.5 FTE to 1.0 FTE to provide clerical/administration support to Behavioral \nHealth administration resulting from Proposition 1 required reform elements. The position is funded with MHSA/BHSA. \nDETAIL BY REVENUE\nCATEGORY AND\nAPPROPRIATION CATEGORY\n2023/24\n ACTUAL\n2024/25 \nADOPTED\nBUDGET\n2025/26\nRECOMMENDED\nFROM\nADOPTED TO\nRECOMMENDED\nPERCENT\nCHANGE\nREVENUES\nFINES, FORFEITURES, & PENALTY\n20,595\n24,024\n15,617\n(8,407)\n(35.0%)\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL REV STATE\n47,037,032\n91,214,340\n30,737,076\n(60,477,264)\n(66.3%)\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL REV FEDERAL\n36,964,545\n37,313,773\n42,037,275\n4,723,502\n12.7%\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL REV OTHER\n92,311\n55,000\n54,688,722\n54,633,722\n99334.0%\nCHARGES FOR SERVICES\n13,335,963\n487,745\n630,854\n143,109\n29.3%\nMISC REVENUE\n1,270,754\n1,455,349\n0\n(1,455,349)\n(100.0%)\nOTHER FINANCING SOURCES\n34,301,852\n39,428,605\n40,566,762\n1,138,157\n2.9%\nGENERAL FUND CONTRIBUTION\n8,567,396\n12,675,464\n13,475,464\n800,000\n6.3%\nTOTAL REVENUES\n141,590,447\n182,654,300\n182,151,770\n(502,530)\n(0.3%)\nAPPROPRIATIONS\nSALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\n35,949,827\n43,428,954\n44,983,145\n1,554,191\n3.6%\nSERVICES AND SUPPLIES\n7,765,219\n11,273,176\n11,873,239\n600,063\n5.3%\nOTHER CHARGES\n93,159,347\n121,130,430\n118,804,991\n(2,325,439)\n(1.9%)\nLEASES\n13,975\n24,143\n20,961\n(3,182)\n(13.2%)\nOTHER FINANCING USES\n567,991\n744,454\n274,771\n(469,683)\n(63.1%)\nINTRA-FUND TRANSFERS\n4,104,205\n6,617,726\n6,674,398\n56,672\n0.9%\nTOTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n141,560,565\n183,218,883\n182,631,505\n(587,378)\n(0.3%)\nNET CHANGE\n(29,882)\n564,583\n479,735\n(84,848)\n(15.0%)\nSTAFFING\nBEHAVIORIAL HEALTH\n241.05\n253.55\n255.25\n1.70\n0.7%\nTOTAL STAFFING\n241.05\n \n253.55\n \n255.25\n \n1.70\n0.7%\n\n7780 \u2013 Fund 902-Behavioral Health \nSummary of Division Budget \nEmery Cowan, Director of Health & Social Services \nHealth & Public Assistance \n \n \n \nJ-24 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \n\u2022 \nAdd 0.2 FTE Mental Health Clinician (Licensed) to increase a 0.8 FTE to 1.0 FTE to address increased workload in the \nCentralized Assessment Team.

The position is funded with Providing \nAccess and Transforming Health (PATH) Justice Involved (JI) Round 3 grand funding. \nPENDING ISSUES AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS \nThe Governor\u2019s FY2025/26 Proposed Budget projects minimal growth in revenues; however, program costs continue to increase. \nExpenses are outpacing growth in revenues in future fiscal years, driving in part by new, unfunded mandates and initiatives. The \nFY2025/26 Recommended Budget uses all prior year unspent revenues to fund operating costs in FY2025/26. \nBehavioral Health is currently not aware of any changes to federal laws that would directly affect the delivery of county behavioral \nhealth services for FY2025/26. However, Congress has released a budget framework directing the House Energy and Commerce \nCommittee\u2014which oversees Medicaid\u2014to identify billions in cuts over the next decade. While specific reductions have not been \ndetailed, the proposal includes potential cost-saving measures such as lowering the federal matching rate (FMAP) to states and \nimposing work requirements, among other proposals. Reductions to or revisions to Medi-Cal (i.e. Medicaid) will necessarily impact \nbehavioral health clients\u2019 eligibility and/or service levels. Additionally, on March 24, 2025, the State Department of Health Care \nServices (DHCS) received notice from the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) that \ngrants provided under the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2020 (H.R. 6074) and \nthe American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (H.R. 1319) were terminated effective immediately. This termination impacts both mental \nhealth and substance use prevention and treatment block grants, resulting in a reduction of COVID-era funding by approximately \n$140,000. \nBehavioral Health has finalized new MOUs between the County\u2019s two managed care plans: Kaiser Permanente and Partnership \nHealthPlan. The State\u2019s guidance on the \u201cdivision of financial responsibility\u201d for eating disorders, as outlined in BHIN 22-009 and \nAPL 22-003, is interpreted as a 50/50 cost share by Partnership but Kaiser is arguing that the County should absorb a higher cose \nshare. Behavioral Health is working with California Behavioral Health Directors Association (CBHDA), evaluating the fiscal \nimplications, and continuing discussions with Kaiser \nCalifornia is increasing accountability measures for local governments to address homelessness, housing, and behavioral health \nand has a new online tool, accountability.ca.gov, that tracks local progress on these issues. Additionally, the State is also \nimplementing stronger accountability measures, including funding claw back provisions for failed progress. \nSenate Bill (SB43), which is an unfunded mandate, expands California\u2019s Lanterman-Petris-Short (LPS) conservatorship law by \nupdating the criteria for determining if a person is \u201cgravely disabled,\u201d the standard for LPS conservatorship eligibility. The new \ndefinition allows for consideration of whether a person fails to provide for their own medical care or personal safety and includes \nnot just mental illness, but also severe substance use disorder and chronic alcoholism. There is currently an insufficient number \nof treatment beds to support those with mental health and even fewer beds for those needing SUD residential or withdrawal \nmanagement/detox. On December 15, 2023, the Board approved deferring implementation until January 2026 to provide time for \nreviewing and updating policies, 5150 training for staff and peace officers, development of workflows and data tracking of \ninvoluntary holds, increasing treatment beds for crisis and inpatient services. A priority in the next year will be to develop or expand \ninpatient, sobering centers, and crisis and residential placements for the increasingly eligible group of people. \nProposition 1, approved by voters in March 2024, contained two broad components: 1) changes the Mental Health Services Act \n(MHSA) to the Behavioral Health Services Act (BHSA) and adjustments to funding and funding categories; and 2) approval of a \n$6.4 billion bond to build more facilities for mental health care and drug or alcohol treatment, and more housing for people with \nmental health, and drug or alcohol challenges. While Proposition 1 makes no changes to the amount of revenue collected through \nthe tax, it does reduce the amount available to counties and how counties may use the funding. Most significantly, BHSA creates \na requirement that one-third (30%) of the funds allocated to each county must be spent on housing. It also shifts 10% of the \nfunding (versus 5%) from counties to the State for workforce initiatives and prevention. Another significant change is the new \nBHSA planning process requiring an Integrated Plan for all behavioral health services that includes budget and outcome \ninformation across all funding sources, not just MHSA as previously established, creating another unfunded mandate for additional \nadministrative functions. Implementation activities are underway in order to adhere to the new Integrated Plan required by July 1, \n2026.",

This initiative includes a five-year Medicaid section 1115 demonstration, State Plan \nAmendments (SPAs) to expand coverage of Evidence-Based Practices (EBPs), and complementary policies to strengthen \nbehavioral health services statewide. BH-CONNECT reduces reliance on facility-based care while focusing on community support \nto improve outcomes,expands Medi-Cal coverage for both adult and child/youth-focused EBPs, and offers training and technical \nassistance through Centers of Excellence. Additionally, the initiative supports a $1.9 billion incentive program to reward behavioral \nhealth plans for improving access and outcomes. BH-CONNECT also strengthens family-based services for children and youth, \nbolsters the State's behavioral health workforce with resources and training, and allows counties to opt into new services and \nprograms to improve care. Solano Behavioral Health has opted in to the EBPs and incentive payments, as four of the required \nEBPs are already offered, which will be expanded through BHSA. \nThe DHCS PATH Justice-Involved Initiative allows incarcerated individuals to enroll in Medi-Cal and receive targeted services up \nto 90 days before their release. California became the first state approved to offer these Medicaid services to eligible youth and \nadults in state prisons, county jails, and youth correctional facilities. The initiative ensures continuity of healthcare coverage and \nservices during incarceration and post-release, providing medications, medical equipment, and transition support. Successful \nimplementation requires collaboration across multiple agencies, including Behavioral Health, Public Health, Probation, and \ncommunity organizations. While the PATH funding supports planning and initial implementation, the program does not \nprovideongoing funding for operational costs. Solano Behavioral Health is pending the Sheriff\u2019s Office implementation of PATH \nrequirements that include electronic health records and Medi-Cal billing within the jail in order to coordinate care pre-release and \nsupport early access to services. \nBroader behavioral health reforms for Medi-Cal Managed Care Plans (MCP) and commercial insurance align behavioral health \nbenefits across all health plans in California. These reforms will require close partnership with both Medi-Cal and commercial \nhealth plans to address opportunities to build needed programs and capacity. This would significantly increase accountability for \nservices provided and outcomes achieved for all Californians through greater reporting expectations and transparency around \naccess, quality, equity, and cost/revenue data which is currently applied to all county behavioral health plans. \nState Audits and Cost Reports \nMedi-Cal cost report audits continue to be delayed. DHCS is currently auditing the FY2014/15 and FY2015/16 Short Doyle cost \nreports, and FY2018/19 Substance Abuse cost report. Counties continue to be concerned about the lag in timing of audits and \nthe lack of consistency in how costs are treated. The County\u2019s FY2022/23 Medi-Cal cost report was submitted in July 2024 and \nis the last cost report that will be reconciled to cost. Proposition 1 requires counties to submit a Behavioral Health Outcomes, \nAccountability, and Transparency Report (BHOATR) that encompasses all funding sources. Counties are awaiting details and \nguidance on this new requirement. DHCS has indicated that this new report will begin in FY2026/27. \nDHCS also continues to indicate their intent to recoup from counties pervious DHCS errors related to State withholdings for the \nnonfederal share of some inpatient bed days and State claims for services not federally eligible due to unsatisfactory immigration \nstatus. Timing and how the recoupment will occur remain unknown. Total statewide recoupment for both is $63.5 million.",

The majority of patients served by FHS are Medi-Cal \nrecipients; however, there are a number of uninsured, vulnerable underinsured, and homeless patients served by the clinics as \nmandated by Welfare and Institutions Code \u00a7 17000. \nThe key functional areas in Family Health Services include primary care, dental care, and behavioral health care for non-specialty \nmental health services. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nIn December 2024, Solano Family Health Services had 28,681 Medi-Cal enrollees assigned through Partnership HealthPlan of \nCalifornia (PHC). \n\u2022 \nAll FHS clinics are open to new member assignments from PHC with the exception of pediatric services in Vacaville and \nVallejo. \n\u2022 \nProvider recruitment continues to be an ongoing challenge. In addition to recruitment efforts through the County Department \nof Human Resources, FHS works with a specialized recruitment firm to recruit providers. \n\u2022 \nThe OCHIN EPIC electronic medical record system went live in September 2024 and implementation continues towards its \nfull functionality. It is anticipated that once implementation is completed, provider performance and client throughput, as well \nas access to quality data, will substantially improve, which can improve overall patient outcomes as well as generate, through \nincreased provider productivity, additional encounter-based revenue. The new system was funded with $2.57 million in one-\ntime American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) - Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) commitment by the \nBoard of Supervisors and $1.0 million that was jointly secured by Representative Garamendi and Senator Padilla through the \nfederal Community Project Funding initiative. \n\u2022 \nFHS has implemented chiropractic care at the three adult primary care clinics and licensed marriage and family therapist \n(LMFT) services at the pediatric primary care clinic. \nWORKLOAD INDICATORS \n\u2022 \nIn 2024 the \u201cWe're All Family!\u201d Mobile Food Pharmacy (MFP) program, sponsored by the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation, saw \nan increase of 6.4% in the average total pounds of healthy and nutritious produce distributed; however, the number of Food \nRx Prescriptions redeemed by clients (food boxes) decreased by 39%. Since the official launch of the program, the MFP has \nprovided more than 1,720 tons of free and fresh produce to low-income families. \n\u2022 \nIn 2024, FHS provided primary care and dental health services to 17,329 patients, an increase of 149 patients from 2023. \nThere were a total of 45,494 patient visits, which represents a decrease of 9.8% from the prior year \n\u2022 \nIn 2024, of the 17,329 FHS patients reporting, 49.7% of FHS patients lived below 100% of the Federal Poverty Line (FPL) \nand 93.9% of FHS patients had Medi-Cal Managed Care as their primary insurance or are dually enrolled in Medicare and \nMedi-Cal. \nDIVISION BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents increases of $275,852 or 0.7% in both revenues and appropriations when compared to \nthe FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. The Recommended Budget includes a combination of $9,356,313 in 1991 Public Health \nRealignment and $2,500,000 in County General Fund to fund the projected program operational shortfalls.",

Primary care and dental clinics are designated as FQHC sites through the Healthcare for \nthe Homeless grant administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). FQHCs are non-profit or public \nentities that serve designated medically underserved populations/areas or special medically underserved populations comprised \nof migrant and seasonal farmworkers, the homeless or residents of public housing. The FQHC designation allows clinics to bill a \nbundled rate per visit (PPS \u2013 prospective payment system) instead of a fee-for-service rate. \nFQHC reimbursement is based on a site-specific encounter (i.e. patient visit) rate with an interim encounter rate established during \na designated rate setting year. The California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) has established permanent rates for \nall FHS sites. Other important funding sources for Family Health Services include the Health Care for the Homeless grant and the \nRyan White (HIV/AIDS) grant. \nFHS continues to experience operating losses due to insufficient FQHC revenues partly caused by an insufficient number of daily \nencounters, ramping up of services of new providers, provider vacancies and the current site-specific encounter rates not keeping \nup with inflationary costs. \nThe clinics are currently undergoing a process to submit for encounter rate adjustments at each location through a Change in \nScope of Service Request (CSOSR) process. As part of the process two new services were added including chiropractic services \nfor adults and licensed marriage and family therapy services for pediatrics. The outcome of this effort is estimated to be completed \nin Spring 2026 with any rate adjustments retroactive to July 1, 2025. This effort helps to improve but is not anticipated to fully \neliminate the current structural deficit. Productivity (the number of daily encounters) will need to increase along with certain quality \nmeasures. \nH&SS is utilizing 1991 Public Health Realignment to cover the majority of the FHS structural deficit, i.e., funding gap. However, \n1991 Public Health Realignment is a primary source of county funding for the provision of Public Health services and the continued \nuse of 1991 Public Health Realignment in FHS negatively impacts Public Health\u2019s ability to sustain, core functions of Public Health. \nThe FY2024/25 Adopted Budget included a combination of $3.0 million in 1991 Public Health Realignment and the utilization of \n$4.7 million in ARPA (see glossary for definition) revenue replacement/recovery funds to support the FHS clinics; however, ARPA- \nfunds are no longer available. \nThe Recommended Budget represents an increase of $275,852 in revenues primarily due to: \n\u2022 \nDecrease of $2,177,021 in Charges for Services resulting from reduced FQHC revenues due to a projected decrease in total \nencounters resulting from insufficient daily encounter targets, provider vacancies, and the encounter rates. \n\u2022 \nDecrease of $56,608 in Federal Other due to fully expending the rollover balance of one-time federal Community Project \nfunding secured by Representative Garamendi and Senator Padilla for the electronic health record system. \n\u2022 \nDecrease of $100,405 in Federal Direct \u2013 COVID-19 due remaining balances of one-time COVID-19 related grants fully \nexpended in FY2024/25. \n\u2022 \nDecrease of $4,708,209 in ARPA one-time funds . \n\u2022 \nIncrease of $2,500,000 in County General Fund to support clinic operations. \n\u2022 \nIncrease of $6,265,226 in 1991 Public Health Realignment for a total of $10,652,623 for FY2025/26 and which reflects the \nuse of $1,296,310 to fund the cost of care of the uninsured and underinsured (under WIC \u00a717000) that cannot be covered by \nthe (HRSA) Section 330 grant and for the cost of Public Health services being provided at the FHS clinics, such as \nimmunization, viral and tuberculosis care. The additional $6,355,822 of 1991 Public Health Realignment is utilized to support \nclinic operations. \n\u2022 \nDecrease of $170,334 in Miscellaneous Revenues primarily due to an estimated decrease in quality incentive revenues from \nPartnership HealthPlan. \nThe Recommended Budget represents an increase of $275,852 in appropriations primarily due to: \n\u2022 \nSalaries and Employee Benefits reflect a decrease of $1,637,419 due to an increase in anticipated salary savings resulting \nfrom challenges in filling some positions.",

The position provides high-level data analysis for \nthe Quality Assurance Team and is funded with 1991 Public Health Realignment. \nThe FY2025/26 Recommended Budget includes the following position allocation changes: \n\u2022 \nDelete 1.0 FTE Administrative Secretary (vacant). \n\u2022 \nAdd 1.0 FTE Office Assistant III to provide complex clerical and administrative support to the Clinic Operations Officer. The \nposition will be funded with payer revenues; however, if these revenues are insufficient, 1991 Public Health Realignment will \nfund the position. \nPENDING ISSUES AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS \nFamily Health Services continues to focus on operational, quality and process improvements in order to optimize client services, \nquality outcomes and revenue generation and anticipates implementing a number of changes, including provision of a patient \nportal, improved resources for clients using telehealth, and more robust appointment scheduling. With the implementation of \nOCHIN EPIC the electronic medical record system, and provider performance and client throughput, as well as access to quality \ndata, is anticipated to substantially improve which can improve overall patient outcomes as well as generate additional encounter-\nbased revenue. \nIn order to improve the financial sustainability of the clinics, FHS is pursuing several initiatives, including encounter rate \nadjustments for each of the FHS clinics, increased quality indicator revenue from Partnership HealthPlan of California (PHC), and \nincreased provider productivity. Chiropractic services have been added to the three adult primary care clinics and licensed \nmarriage and family therapy services at the Fairfield pediatric clinic. These new services have been approved by Health Resources \nand Services Administration (HRSA) and a rate reassessment by the California Department of Health Care Services of the current \nencounter rates at each of the FHS clinic sites will be submitted during the first quarter of FY2025/26. The outcome of this effort \nis estimated to be completed in Spring 2026 with any rate adjustments retroactive to July 1, 2025.",

Public \nHealth performs surveillance for communicable diseases, chronic diseases and injuries, and risk factors for health conditions, and \nit responds to emerging disease threats and outbreaks. It provides services to vulnerable populations and focuses on prevention \nof disease, disability, and harmful health outcomes. Public Health collaborates with the healthcare community and community \npartners to inform and coordinate on issues of importance and communicates with the public to provide residents with sufficient \ninformation to make healthy choices. Public Health is in the forefront of fostering and participating in community coalitions and \nprofessional networks, as well as in developing public health policies, and it is responsible for enforcing public health laws and \nregulations. Public Health also assists with emergency planning and response activities. \nKey functional areas in Public Health include communicable disease control, surveillance and epidemiology, health promotion and \ncommunity wellness, emergency services, public health laboratory, maternal, child and adolescent health, nutrition services, and \nvital statistics. In 2015, the Older and Disabled Adult Services Bureau (ODAS) operationally merged with Public Health including \nservices provided through In\u00adHome Supportive Services (IHSS), Adult Protective Services, Public Administrator / Public Guardian \n/ Public Conservator, and the IHSS Public Authority (PA). In 2019, the Napa/Solano Area Agency on Aging (N/S AAA) was \nestablished in the Older and Disabled Adult Services Bureau. For financial purposes, the budget and metrics for ODAS, the IHSS \nPA and the N/S AAA are included in Budget Unit 7680, Social Services. \nIn 2022, the Solano County Board of Supervisors approved a reorganization of Public Health to create the Emergency Services, \nPreparedness, Immunizations and Communicable Disease (EPIC) Bureau to integrate the Emergency Services Bureau and \nCommunicable Disease Program under one public health bureau. The EPIC Bureau was formed to integrate and coordinate efforts \nacross disciplines that need to respond during a public health emergency, including a pandemic. In addition to overseeing the \ntimely detection, prevention and control for all reportable diseases, the EPIC Bureau is comprised of Emergency Medical Services \n(EMS), Emergency Preparedness and Response, and the Immunization Program. In a public health emergency, the bureau works \nclosely with the health care community to monitor hospital capacity, reduce the spread of disease, conduct contact tracing and \ncase investigations to reduce spread of disease, provide support for emergency operations, distribute critical supplies (e.g., \npersonal protective equipment), coordinate emergency medical services (EMS) resources, distribute vaccines and therapeutic \nagents as needed and operate vaccination clinics. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \n\u2022 \nThe Epidemiology Unit expanded its workforce and continues to take a lead role in coordinating and providing technical \nassistance to healthcare providers, partner agencies and other stakeholders in preventing additional deaths and illnesses \ndue to influenza, coronavirus, and other transmissible diseases. With the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, this unit has \nreturned to analyzing data related to health equity issues. In 2025, the Epidemiology Unit will launch a new health indicator \nand social determinants of health data resource for the community on the new Solano County website. This data will help \ncommunity partners with program planning and resource development. \n\u2022 \nThe Oral Health Education Program of the Health Promotion and Community Wellness Bureau provided 305 children with \nfree fluoride varnish application/dental screening and children received oral health education. \n\u2022 \nWith CalAIM implementation, Medi-Cal managed care plans and behavioral health are required to work with local health \njurisdictions to develop the Community Health Assessment, Community Health Improvement Plan, and Public Health\u2019s \nStrategic Plan. A Community Health Assessment update will begin in 2025. \n\u2022 \nPublic Health continued its partnership with Trauma Transformed to implement a Trauma Informed Systems (TIS) framework \ntoward becoming a more healing organization. Over the past four years this has involved providing TIS 101 trainings to \nhundreds of H&SS staff and community partners; a trauma informed continuous quality improvement series including an",

The funding sources for \nMedical Services are 1991 Realignment, Forfeitures and Penalties, and County General Fund. \nOn June 30, 2022, Public Health received notification from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) that Solano County \nwould receive $2,060,478 in Future of Public Health (FoPH) funding provided through the California Budget Act of 2022. This new \nongoing annual State funding is to be used to build the capacity for local health jurisdictions to respond to current and future \nemergencies through strengthening and expanding the local public health workforce. \nThe Recommended Budget represents a decrease of $1,994,818 or 3.8% in revenues primarily due to: \n\u2022 \nIncrease of $380,074 in interest income on restricted IGT funds. \n\u2022 \nDecrease of $483,323 in COVID-19 State Direct and State Pass Through primarily due to a decrease in the Epidemiology \nand Laboratory Capacity (ELC) grant funding, Maternal, Infant, Early Childhood Home Visiting Program (MIECHV) American \nRescue Plan Act Supplemental funding and the ending of one-time COVID-19 Immunization revenues. \n\u2022 \nNet decrease in federal and State grants and allocations of $2,853,738 and $1,184,349, respectively. The decreases are \nlargely due to a decrease in prior year revenues resulting from cash flow and revenue recognition of prior year claims offset \nby increases in Title XIX funding for home visiting programs, WIC program allocation and increase in staff budgeted in MCAH \nprograms. \n\u2022 \nIncrease of $383,246 in Future of Public Health (FoPH) infrastructure funds due to timing of claims and reimbursements. \n\u2022 \nIncrease of $3,042,406 in 1991 Public Health Realignment primarily due to decreases in prior year revenues and ending of \none-time COVID-19 funding and reduction in IGT revenues as the pool of participants has increased, reducing available \nfunding. In prior years, 1991 Public Health Realignment has been used to fill in gaps in funding due to cash flow delays in \ndelays of payments for various allocations and grants. \n\u2022 \nDecrease of $1,577,266 in IGT revenues due to decrease in available funding as a result of an increased number of \nparticipants in the IGT program. \n\u2022 \nIncrease of $157,942 in Charges for Services primarily due to an increase in administrative service fees from the Solano \nEmergency Medical Services Cooperative (SEMSC) and offset by a decrease in recording fees. \n\u2022 \nDecrease of $148,558 in Miscellaneous Revenues is primarily due to decreases in revenue for the bicycle helmet and car \nseat programs, and a partial year of Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation (YDWN) donation funding for the Vibe Solano program. The \nYDWN donation is for a calendar year, therefore funding is included through December 2025. \nPrimary Costs \nPrimary costs for Health Services are $30,054,475 for Salaries and Employee Benefits, $10,338,891 for Services and \nSupplies, $11,983,772 for Other Charges, $20,000 for Other Financing Uses, and $3,628,283 for Intrafund Transfers. \nThe Recommended Budget for the Health Services Division includes $48,902,933 in appropriations for Public Health (BU \n7800) and $7,134,420 for Medical Services (BU 7588). \nThe Recommended Budget represents a decrease of $3,554,698 or 6.0% in appropriations primarily due to: \n\u2022 \nSalaries and Employee Benefits reflect an increase of $332,899 primarily due to increases in wages, retirement and health \nbenefit costs, offset by decreases in extra-help, compensation insurance and accrued leave payoff. \n\u2022 \nServices and Supplies reflect a decrease of $1,979,980 in primarily due to decreases in software maintenance and support, \ncontracted services and special departmental expenditures. \n\u2022 \nOther Charges reflect a decrease of $862,535 primarily due to decreases in non-federal share of the IGT, supports for indigent \nclients, Interfund charges from the Auditor-Controller, and Countywide Administrative Overhead. \n\u2022 \nFixed Assets reflect a decrease of $95,000 in Fixed Assets as there are no equipment requests for FY2025/26. \n\u2022 \nOther Financing Uses reflect a decrease of $283,170 due to the full redemption of the Pension Obligation Bonds (POBs).",

DHCS requires Medi-Cal managed care plans to establish \nMemorandums of Understandings (MOUs) with local health jurisdictions and WIC programs. Public Health has concerns with the \nproposed MOUs and continues to work with the Medi-Cal managed care plans to address the concerns, which require prioritizing \nthe managed care clients over other clients and imposing unfunded mandates on local health jurisdictions. \nAs part of California Advancing and Innovating Medi-Cal (CalAIM) implementation, Medi-Cal managed care plans are required to \nwork with county public health and behavioral health agencies to develop Community Health Needs Assessments. For about 20 \nyears, Solano County Public Health has worked with health care agencies, including Kaiser Permanente, NorthBay Medical \nCenter, and Sutter Solano Medical Center to develop the Community Health Needs Assessment. This partnership will be expanded \nto Solano County Behavioral Health and Partnership HealthPlan of California. Additionally, Solano County Public Health will \ncontinue to work with these partners to develop the Community Health Improvement Plan and use it as a tool for prioritizing funding \nand contracts with community-based organizations. The next Community Health Assessment update process will begin in 2025. \nIn mid-2025, Solano Emergency Medical Services Cooperative will issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for ambulance services \nwithin the Exclusive Operating Area. \nPublic Health continues to partner with Employment and Eligibility Services to strengthen the relationship and referrals between \nthe CalFresh and WIC programs. Many WIC clients are eligible for the CalFresh program; however, only about a quarter are \nenrolled in the program. Additionally, Public Health and Child Welfare Services are strengthening referral processes between the \nMaternal, Child, and Adolescent Health Bureau\u2019s home visiting programs and Child Welfare Services. Additionally, Solano Public \nHealth and Solano County Behavioral Health continue to meet and collaborate on joint projects, including Solano County Outreach \nfor the Unhoused Team (SCOUT), prevention of behavioral health issues, emergency medical service response to behavioral \nhealth clients, perinatal mental health services, and many other initiatives. These collaborative efforts, among many others, aim \nto realize an integrated Health and Social Services Department and improve customer service to clients. \nFederal funds have long supported vital public health services to vulnerable populations and prevention of disease, disability, and \nother harmful health outcomes. These services are now in jeopardy due to threatened federal budget cuts and policy rollbacks, \nputting the health and well-being of millions of Californians at risk.",

In addition, the Social Services \nDivision is also responsible for In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) Public Authority Administration (BU 7690) and Napa/Solano \nArea Agency on Aging Administration (AAA) (BU 7685). Staff in these bureaus are responsible for issuing assistance to clients as \nbudgeted in the Assistance Programs Division (BU 7900). \nChild Welfare Services \nCWS is a State supervised, county administered program. The program\u2019s purpose is to prevent, identify and respond to allegations \nof child abuse and neglect. Families in the child welfare system receive services so that children can remain safely in their homes, \nand children who are temporarily removed from their homes can reunify with their families. For cases in which children are unable \nto reunify with their families, efforts are made to find a permanent home through adoption or guardianship. CWS services are \nmandated pursuant to State and federal laws, e.g., Title IV of the Social Security Act, and Chapter 978, California Statutes of \n1982. \nEmployment and Eligibility Services \nE&ES contributes to Solano County residents\u2019 well-being by providing safety net public assistance, housing support, medical \ninsurance enrollment, and employment services. E&ES promotes healthy, safe, and stable lives by assisting low-income families \nand individuals with obtaining employment, access to health care, food, and cash assistance. \nWelfare Administration \nWA and the Special Investigations Bureau (SIB) provide overall administration and program integrity through comprehensive \ninvestigations of fraud allegations in Social Services programs, the collection of debts, and the timely hearing of appeals. \nSpecial Projects \nThe Special Projects budget is used for projects that have funding sources separate from State social services funds and that are \nnot included in the consolidated Social Services County Expense Claim for federal and State reimbursement. \nOlder and Disabled Adult Services \nODAS provides interdisciplinary services to the elderly and disabled who are among the County\u2019s most isolated and vulnerable \nresidents. ODAS focuses on comprehensive, integrated assistance through multiple programs: Adult Protective Services (APS), \nNapa/Solano AAA services, In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS), In-Home Supportive Services Public Authority (IHSS PA), and \nPublic Administrator (PA) / Public Guardian (PG) / Public Conservator (PC). Although included in Social Services for budgeting \npurposes, ODAS is organizationally integrated under the Public Health Division. This integration provides for a preventative health \nfocus for the aged and disabled communities in the county. \nFUNCTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES \nChild Welfare Services \nThe mission of CWS is to protect children from abuse and neglect by strengthening families or finding safe, permanent homes so \nthat children can grow into healthy productive adults. CWS includes 24-hours a day, 7-days a week, Hotline and Emergency \nResponse Services, Family Maintenance and Family Reunification Services, Transition to Permanency, including Adoption \nServices, Supportive Transition Services, and Support Services. The programs were passed by State legislation in 1982 with \nSenate Bill 14 to implement federal requirements under Public Law 96-272. \n\u2022 \nHotline/Emergency Response staff investigate allegations of neglect or abuse of children to determine whether children can \nsafely remain in their own home. Emergency Response may initiate a service plan to reduce risk factors sufficiently to allow \nchildren to remain at home or, if this is not possible, complete the legal documentation to request the Juvenile Court to order \nthe children into foster or relative care. Emergency Response is available 24-hours a day, 7-days a week, to respond to \nsituations in which a child is at imminent risk of abuse or serious neglect.",

These \nindividuals often require specialized care that surpasses funding limits set by Federal Foster Care rates or CalAIM billable \nclaims for specialty mental health services. Moreover, the demand for on-demand placement options has prompted the \nexploration of innovative strategies like \"bed holds,\" which enable providers to reserve spaces for emergencies, though at an \nincreased cost. \n\u2022 \nTo further improve staff retention, Child Welfare Services has continued to invest in the provision of Emotional Intelligence \ntraining and coaching for its supervisors and managers. This leadership strategy focuses on promoting self-awareness and \nsocial awareness to enhance leadership skills. As a result, retention rates have increased from 67% in 2021 to 85% in 2024. \nEmployment and Eligibility Services \n\u2022 \nApplications and active caseload growth continue to grow, impacting timely processing mandates and customer service. To \nmitigate, E&ES launched a continuous quality improvement effort to evaluate workflows and identify opportunities to improve \nefficiencies, beginning with application processing. As a result of the quality improvement effort, application processing \ntimeliness improved by 13% for expedited CalFresh, 15% for CalFresh, 8% for CalWORKs, and 15% for Medi-Cal between \nthe first quarter of 2024 and the fourth quarter, despite a year-over-year increase in applications. \n\u2022 \nFederal policies implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a substantial increase in the Medi-Cal \ncaseload between March 2020 and June 2023. Effective June 2023, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 reinstated \nannual Medi-Cal eligibility redetermination requirements that had been paused under a continuous coverage mandate. As of \nJuly 2024, the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) reported that 84.2% of the required renewals had been \ncompleted statewide. Following the guidelines set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), DHCS extended \nthe deadline to initiate all continuous coverage unwinding renewals to March 31, 2025 and complete all redeterminations by \nJune 30, 2025. E&ES employed various strategies to complete the redetermination backlog and received confirmation of \nsuccessful completion from DHCS on April 22, 2025, meeting the statewide deadline. \n\u2022 \nCalFresh benefits are subject to federal quality control reviews to ensure payment accuracy. States that exceed the 6% error \ntolerance threshold and the national average are subject to sanctions. For FFY2023/24, California\u2019s cumulative error rate is \n10.21% and the national average is 10.83%. However, the Food and Nutrition Services Branch recently released a policy \nclarification that will allow states to review certain cases to determine if they remain errors in accordance with the clarified \npolicy. Therefore, the State will not know until June 2025 if California will be placed on a year one sanction for FFY2023/24, \nwhich would place counties at risk for potential financial sanctions if FFY2024/25 error rates exceed the 6% threshold and the \nnational average. Solano County is one of only two California counties with a 0% active payment error rate FFY2023/24. \n\u2022 \nEffective January 1, 2023, the State of California mandated that all counties implement a Pre-Release Medi-Cal Application \nProcess to ensure all inmates and youth released from County Correctional Facilities, California Department of Corrections \nand Rehabilitation, and County Youth Correctional Facilities have timely access to Medi-Cal services, provided they are \neligible. In 2022, planning and collaboration began between E&ES, the Sheriff\u2019s Office, and Probation to automate the \nidentification and reporting of application outcomes for incarcerated individuals not in receipt of Medi-Cal or who required \ntemporary benefit suspension. In 2024, E&ES processed at total of 427 applications for individuals identified as potentially \neligible for these benefits utilizing a manual process. The automated go-live milestone for this process was achieved on \nJanuary 22, 2025. \n\u2022 \nSupplemental Security Income (SSI) is a federal program that provides financial assistance to older adults and people with \nfederally qualified disabilities who have low income and few resources. Establishing eligibility based on disability is a complex \nprocess that can be difficult to successfully navigate. In 2024, E&ES provided SSI application assistance and advocacy for \n55 disabled community members and 17 of those assisted were approved for SSI payments.",

During the year, E&ES permanently housed 146 new families and prevented evictions for 79 families. \nWhile many families remain on the waitlist, enhanced funding for this program ends in June 2025. \nWelfare Administration \n\u2022 \nThe increased workload from Medi-Cal redeterminations continues to strain capacity throughout FY2024/25, with 131 more \ncases compared to FY2023/24 and an estimated 60% rise in fair hearings related to Medi-Cal programs. The Special \nInvestigations Bureau will continue to evaluate internal business processes to properly manage the growing caseload and \nconsider opportunities to increase staffing when appropriate. \n\u2022 \nThe State Hearings Division has experienced an increase in CalFresh hearings since CalFresh emergency allotments were \ndiscontinued in 2023. Approximately 33,344 Solano County families receive CalFresh benefits. In 2024, there was a 45% \nincrease in administrative hearings associated with CalFresh compared to the previous year and this increased workload is \nprojected to remain consistent throughout 2025. \n\u2022 \nIn August 2024, the Special Investigations Bureau implemented a new records management system, transitioning from a \nlegacy Access database management system to a state-of-the-art records management system (RMS). Nearly 50,000 \nrecords from 2013 through 2024 were effectively migrated to the new system. The new RMS, which is fully supported by \nDoIT, provides simplified data management, advanced performance analysis, and reduced duplication of effort. \nOlder and Disabled Adult Services \n\u2022 \nIn August 2024, the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) informed program staff of the successful completion of \na Quality Improvement Action Plan for maintaining at least 80% in overall reassessments. Calendar year 2024 was the first \nyear since 2020 that a corrective action plan on reassessment compliance goals has not been issued by the State IHSS. \n\u2022 \nStaff continued to participate in the California Office of Emergency Services Victim Services Program Unit Elder Abuse (XE) \ngrant program through October 2024. The community organization, Empowered Aging, obtained the grant and used a portion \nof the funding to sponsor multidisciplinary team meetings to create a larger safety net for older and disabled adults that are \nvictims of crime. Due to reduced funding, the multidisciplinary team meetings ended in October 2024. \n\u2022 \nContinued the State\u2019s Home Safe Program, administered by E&ES, which serves APS clients who are homeless or at risk of \nhomelessness to receive housing support and housing location services. Clients received an array of services including, but \nnot limited to information and referral, emergency placement in hotel rooms and provision of temporary housing in residential \ncare facilities. In the first six months of 2024, 38 clients were evaluated for services with 37 cases receiving interventions to \neither stabilize an at-risk for homelessness or provided shelter if experiencing homelessness. The State discontinued funding \nfor this program as of June 30, 2024. \n\u2022 \nThe IHSS client caseload was at 6,802 by the end of 2024, which is an additional 756 clients over last year. Caseloads \ncontinue to grow in IHSS, and current staff are challenged to meet both the intake and annual reassessment requirements. \n\u2022 \nIn December 2024, the Board honored 44 centenarians, people aged 100 years and older. More than 325 centenarians have \nbeen honored since the celebration\u2019s inception 18 years ago. According to the Pew Research Center, for 2024 there are an \nestimated 101,000 centenarians in the U.S., which is the second highest number in the world. Remarkable examples of \nlongevity and the meaning of quality of life, centenarians age with dignity and grace. In Solano County, centenarians come \nfrom diverse ethnic, socioeconomic, religious, and educational backgrounds. \nWORKLOAD INDICATORS \nChild Welfare Services \n\u2022 \nIn 2024, CWS received 5,269 reports, 107 more than in 2023 and 731 more than in 2022, for allegations of child abuse and \nneglect which were evaluated and addressed. Of these 5,269 reports, 2,242 led to investigations. These investigations led to \n106 children being placed in out of home care. During this same period, 51 children were returned home, and 68 adoptions \nor guardianships were legally ordered. \n\u2022 \nAs of December 2024, CWS had 311 children and youth in out of home placement, as compared to 353 in December 2023. \nOf the 311 children in out of home placements, 78 were with a relative or non-related extended family member, 14 in Short",

E&ES issued over $41 million in cash assistance and over $122 million in \nfood assistance to county residents in 2024, providing financial support to eligible individuals and families while generating \nlocal economic activity. \n\u2022 \nE&ES is responsible for processing applications and managing active cases for key safety net programs, including CalWORKs \ncash assistance and employment readiness, CalFresh nutrition assistance, Medi-Cal health coverage, and the General \nAssistance loan program for indigent adults. In 2024, the average monthly caseload for these programs increased compared \nto 2023: CalWORKs rose by 5.5% to 3,465 cases, CalFresh grew by 6% to 32,556, Medi-Cal remained steady at 76,859, and \nGeneral Assistance saw a significant 10% increase, reaching 468 cases. \n\u2022 \nCalWORKs, General Assistance cash assistance, and CalFresh food assistance caseloads continue to increase. Contrary to \nState projections that the Medi-Cal caseload would experience a significant decline in 2024 as a result of the unwinding of \nthe pandemic-era continuous coverage mandate, Medi-Cal caseloads remained flat. \n\u2022 \nIn 2024, E&ES processed 66,201 safety net program applications, a 12% increase compared to the 58,885 applications \nprocessed in 2023. The reported program applications included in the FY2024/25 Recommended Budget was not correct due \nto the transition from the CalWIN to the CalSAWS statewide system. \n\u2022 \nPublic assistance beneficiaries primarily engage with E&ES in-person and via the toll-free call center. In 2024, the average \nnumber of lobby visits and phone calls to the call center reached 16,754 interactions per month, marking a 17% increase from \nthe 2023 average of 14,339. Consequently, wait times for both the call center and in-person service have increased. \nWelfare Administration \nIn calendar year 2024: \n\u2022 \nThe Special Investigations Bureau (SIB) had 1,488 fraud complaints in need of investigation, of which 1,142 investigations \nwere conducted. At the conclusion of the investigations, 558 resulted in the reduction, denial or discontinuance of benefits or \nthe referral for Administrative Disqualification Hearing (ADH) or prosecution. \n\u2022 \nThe Overpayment Recovery Unit computed 580 (176 CalWORKs and 404 CalFresh) overpayments/over issuances totaling \n$1,568,101. \n\u2022 \nThe Appeals Unit held 2,116 hearings from represented programs, including CalFresh, CMSP, CalWORKs, General \nAssistance, IHSS, and Medi-Cal, representing a 74% workload increase. \nOlder and Disabled Adult Services \nIn calendar year 2024: \n\u2022 \nAPS investigated 3,336 reports of elderly adult and dependent adult abuse, which is a 11.6% increase compared to 2023. \nComplexity of cases as measured by the number of allegations investigated have steadily increased each year with financial \nabuse and self-neglect being the most common. \n\u2022 \nPublic Guardian / Public Conservator managed 379 cases and closed 24 PG / PC cases. \n\u2022 \nPublic Administrator investigated 42 open cases and closed 19 cases. \n\u2022 \nIHSS received 3,202 new applications for services which is a 16% increase compared to 2023.

The County General Fund Contribution of $20,277,649 reflects an increase of $465,990 or 2.4%. \nPrimary Funding Sources \nThe primary funding sources for Social Services 23 major programs are State allocations, federal funds, 2011 Realignment (see \nglossary for definition), and 1991 Realignment (see glossary for definition). Federal funding includes the following: Title IV-E for \nAdoptions, Commercially Sexually Exploited Children (CSEC) Program, Child Welfare Services, Independent Living Program (ILP) \nand Kinship Guardianship Assistance Payment Program (Kin-GAP); Title XIX for Medi-Cal and Health Related (CWS, IHSS and \nAPS); Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF \u2013 see glossary for definition) for CalWORKs and CWS Emergency \nAssistance; Title XX for Child Welfare Services; Title IV-B for Child Welfare Services and Promoting Safe and Stable Families \n(PSSF); Title IIIB, IIIB C1 and C2, and Title IIIE for Napa/Solano AAA Administration, and State Administrative matching grants \nfor the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) from the Department of Agriculture, also known as CalFresh. \nState funds are primarily used for the following programs: Napa/Solano AAA, IHSS, CalWORKs, and CalFresh administration. \nState funds are also allocated to support components of administering child welfare services that are not part of 2011 Realignment \nwhich include the implementation of Continuum of Care Reform (CCR). In the FY2025/26 Recommended Budget, the non-federal \nshare of costs related to CCR activities are funded with State revenue and 1991 Realignment. \nH&SS is projecting to use approximately $27.4 million in Realignment revenues in FY2025/26. The estimated Realignment \nreceipts are projected to be the same as FY2024/25 base receipts. Realignment revenues, both 1991 and 2011, are funded \nthrough sales tax and Vehicle License Fees (VLF). H&SS is projecting that there will be sufficient combined 1991 and 2011 \nRealignment revenues to cover projected expenditures in FY2025/26. \nCounty General Fund is used to fund 100% of the administration costs of the General Assistance, Public Guardian (net of fees \ncollected), and SSI Advocacy programs. The County provides County General Fund for the administration of Child Welfare \nServices equivalent to 24% of the non-federal costs. It also provides County General Fund for the administration of CalFresh, \nCalWORKs, Medi-Cal, and IHSS when federal and State allocations are not sufficient to cover the costs. \nProjecting revenues for Social Services continues to be a challenge due to variations in caseloads, staff time studies for programs, \nand available State and federal allocation information. Costs for the administration of Social Services programs are shared by \nfederal, State, and county agencies based on ratios developed from the State Quarterly County Expense Claim (CEC) (see \nglossary for definition) which may vary based on time study hours and caseloads. In developing the budget, various assumptions \nmust be made based on these factors. \nThe Recommended Budget represents an increase of $3,139,642 in revenues primarily due to: \n\u2022 \nIncrease of $2,106,332 in combined 1991 and 2011 Realignment revenues representing increased need of Realignment \nrevenue to cover projected program costs and cash flows in Social Services and resulting in a larger transfer from the \nRealignment reserve accounts \n\u2022 \nIncrease of $8,061,260 in combined State and federal revenues primarily due to projected increases in Medi-Cal, CalWORKs, \nand Child Welfare Services revenues. \n\u2022 \nDecrease of $7,367,108 in prior year State and federal revenues primarily due to change in revenue recognition compared to \nFY2024/25 Adopted Budget. Revenues are now recognized in the same year the expenditures are incurred. \n\u2022 \nDecrease of $181,548 in Other Revenues primarily due to lower projected charges for services of Public Guardian Unit based \non FY2024/25 year-to-date collections and expiration of the Local Aging and Disability Action Program (LADAP) grant in \nFY2024/25. \n\u2022 \nIncrease of $465,990 in County General Fund Contribution primarily due to increase in allocated costs to the administration \nof Medi-Cal program. \n\u2022 \nDecrease of $935 in Operating Transfers-In.",

The positions are currently vacant and will expire on June 30, 2025. \nOn October 22, 2024, the Board approved the deletion of 1.0 Accounting Clerk III (vacant) and the addition of 1.0 FTE Accounting \nTechnician. At the June 28, 2005 Budget Hearings, the Human Resources Director was authorized to reclassify Accounting Clerk \nIII classifications to Accounting Clerk II or Accounting Technician (as appropriate) as the positions are vacated or to reflect current \nposition occupant\u2019s job classification, pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with bargaining units. H&SS and \nHuman Resources reviewed the job specification and based on duties being requested of the full-time position, it was determined \nthis position be reclassified as an Accounting Technician. \nThere are no changes in position allocation in the FY2025/26 Recommended Budget. \nOlder and Disabled Adult Services \nOn March 12, 2024, as part of the Midyear Financial Report, the following position change was approved by the Board: \n\u2022 \nFY2023/24 Midyear included a \u2018TBD\u2019 position to provide support for the administration of the Napa/Solano Area Agency on \nAging. Based on the work duties, Human Resources determined that the duties aligned with the Project Manager \nclassification. The Board approved the Project Manager classification determination in December 2024. \nThere are no changes in position allocation in the FY2025/26 Recommended Budget. \nPENDING ISSUES AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS \nChild Welfare Services \nFoster Family Agencies (FFAs) are required to maintain insurance. The largest insurance provider for California FFAs, Nonprofits \nInsurance Alliance of California (NIAC), announced in 2024 that it would no longer renew policies for FFAs. As a result, FFAs are \nbeing forced to seek new insurance providers, often at significantly higher costs. This financial strain has put many FFAs at risk \nof closure as their insurance policies expire. \nAs of December 2024, there are 108 children placed in an FFA. There is growing concern that potential FFA closures could lead \nto the displacement of some or all of these children. The situation is being closely monitored to ensure that the well-being and \nplacement stability of these children are not adversely affected. \nEmployment and Eligibility Services \nThe Governor's FY2025/26 Proposed Budget includes several proposals that would impact Employment and Eligibility Services \n(E&ES) program administration. The division will closely monitor the May Revise and the final State Budget for impacts. \nThere are currently several proposals for federal funding cuts to social service programs, including Medi-Cal, CalFresh, and other \nincome security programs. With the significant change in federal priorities, it is anticipated that additional budget and policy \nchanges may impact eligibility, program enrollment rates, benefit levels, and/or service delivery for public assistance programs in \nFY2025/26. \nCalFresh, CalWORKs, and General Assistance benefits are delivered to eligible recipients on Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) \ncards, which function like debit cards. Electronic theft of benefits from EBT cards continues to be a significant issue. In 2024, \n$2,324,483 in cash and food benefits were stolen from county residents. In most circumstances, benefits must be replaced by \nEmployment and Eligibility staff within 10 days of the reported theft. To combat electronic benefit theft, the State announced that \nit would be replacing existing EBT cards with new Chip EMV/Tap enabled cards, which was originally scheduled to begin in the \nsummer of 2024. However, CDSS commenced distribution of replacement EMV chip/tap cards in February 2025. The FY2025/26 \nState budget assumes a significant reduction in skimming as a result of this strategy, but success is largely dependent on retailer \nadoption of chip/tap EBT card devices and customer use of the tap option.",

During 2022, the \ntimeframe for CalWORKs overpayment determinations decreased from no time limitation to a maximum of two years preceding \nnotification. CalFresh timelines decreased from three to two years. In addition, a systemic 9-month lag in the receipt of quarterly \nwage information reported by the Employment Development Department (EDD), coupled with restrictions on the immediate \nverification of income discrepancies with the payment source and frequently uncooperative on non-responsive clients and \nemployers further increases the demands placed upon staff and negatively impact timely claim establishment and resulting in \nlowered or no citable claims. \nOlder and Disabled Adult Services \nIn 2024, Medi-Cal eligibility asset limits were eliminated and eligibility was expanded to include adults aged 26-49 years who \nqualify by income, regardless of immigration status. These changes are factors in the 11.8% growth in IHSS caseloads compared \nto a smaller percentage in prior years. \nIn 2019, Governor Newsom signed an executive order calling for the creation of a Master Plan for Aging (MPA). The State MPA \nis a 10-year blueprint that reflects California\u2019s future vision of and commitment to an age- and ability-forward state. The MPA \noutlines five key areas related to aging, including housing, health care, equity and inclusion, and affordability of aging. In 2023, \nODAS received a $200,000 Local Aging and Disability Action Plan (LADAP) grant from the California Department of Aging to \ncreate a local aging and disability friendly community plan. The 15-month process consisted of 19 community listening sessions \nof over 361 seniors and people with disabilities capturing 1,011 comments. The information gathered with the community \nengagement identified trends that are presented in the Solano Master Plan on Aging and Disability report which is available on \nthe Napa / Solano Area Agency on Aging website. The report provides insight into the thoughts and concerns of older adults and \nadults with disabilities living in Solano County communities. \nIn addition, Napa/Solano Area Agency on Aging, in collaboration with Independent Living Resources of Solano and Contra Costa \nCounties, began the second year of the Solano Aging and Disability Resource Connection (ADRC). The ADRC promotes \nintegration of service delivery, one stop information and referrals for more coordination of services between aging service delivery \nentities, including county and community agencies. By the end of 2024, the ADRC was averaging serving nearly 600 people every \nmonth. Funding for continued operation and growth of the ADRC is not certain through stable funding with the California \nDepartment of Aging. Federal funding cuts to Aging and Disability Resource Centers are a significant concern, as funding cuts \ncould lead to reduced access to critical services for older adults and people with disabilities, longer wait times, and potentially \nclosure of some centers. \nThe Home Safe Program offers strategies to address and prevent homelessness and support ongoing housing stability for Adult \nProtective Services (APS) clients. Clients have received an array of services including, but not limited to information and referral, \nemergency placement in hotel rooms and provision of temporary housing in residential care facilities and permanent housing. \nCurrent program funding expires June 30, 2025.",

In addition to serving as the employer of record \nfor IHSS providers, the IHSS PA also provides services to IHSS consumers. Health and Social Services\u2019 (H&SS) Social Services \nDivision, through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the IHSS PA Board, provides the administration for the IHSS PA. \nThis budget unit was established to track revenues and expenditures for staff positions and other operating costs affiliated with \nFUNCTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES \nH&SS dedicates staff and operating expenditures in this budget unit to fulfill the requirements set forth in Welfare and Institutions \nCode \u00a712301.6 as follows: a) operate as the employer of IHSS providers for the purposes of collective bargaining over wages, \nhours, and other terms of employment such as administering health benefits; b) assist IHSS consumers in finding IHSS providers \nthrough the establishment of a registry of IHSS providers and a referral system under which IHSS providers shall be referred \n(recipient \u2013 provider matching services); c) investigate the qualifications and background of all IHSS providers; d) provide training \nto IHSS providers and consumers; e) provide administrative support to the IHSS PA Advisory Committee; and f) perform any other \nfunctions as necessary for the operation of the IHSS PA. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nIn calendar year 2024: \n\u2022 \nIHSS PA continued to recruit providers to the Registry, receiving 448 applications which is 147 or 49% more applications than \nlast year. New interventions were attempted to assist applicants in completing the Registry onboarding such as reducing the \nwait time to interview, providing one-on-one sessions for onboarding details, and prioritizing provider orientation for Registry \nprovider applicants. Staff were successful at adding 99 new IHSS Caregivers to the Registry which was a 115% increase \ncompared to 2023. \n\u2022 \nThe average number of active IHSS providers on the Registry was 274, with 137 already fully assigned to work for one or \nmore consumers. The IHSS PA received 1,043 requests for caregivers in 2024. Due to limited available caregivers on the \nRegistry, 87% of IHSS consumers were not able to get matched with a caregiver on the Registry. IHSS PA staff assisted \nconsumers with connections and resources to find alternative caregivers. \n\u2022 \nThe Backup Provider System (BUPS), implemented in October 2022, allows the IHSS PA to refer or dispatch an emergency \ncaregiver to an IHSS consumer in need of an emergency or backup caregiver for up to 80 hours per fiscal year. In 2024, \nthere were seven requests for emergency providers. \nWORKLOAD INDICATORS \nIn calendar year 2024: \n\u2022 \nThe IHSS PA maintained an average of 274 providers on the IHSS PA Provider Registry to serve an average of 419 IHSS \nconsumers per month. These providers represent a subset on the 5,821 IHSS paid providers countywide as of November \n2024. \n\u2022 \nProcessed 448 applications from individuals interested in being placed on the IHSS PA Provider Registry, resulting in 99 new \nproviders added. \n\u2022 \nReceived and processed 1,043 provider list requests from IHSS recipients who requested assistance in finding a provider. \n\u2022 \nProvided 3,108 intervention services including intake, information and assistance, mediation to resolve complex issues, and \nfollow-up. \n\u2022 \nIHSS PA staff administered health benefits to an average of 1,351 IHSS providers per month. All eligible IHSS providers who \nrequested to be added to the health plan were enrolled within 30 days of receiving the request throughout the year. In addition \nto this benefit, IHSS PA staff issued 20,480 pairs of gloves and 2,070 masks to IHSS consumers upon request. \n\u2022 \nIHSS PA advertised the availability of First Aid and CPR classes to all IHSS providers and assisted with their enrollment in \nthe classes and the issuance of their First Aid/CPR card.",

Recruitment and retention of providers on the Registry remains challenging as the number \nof new IHSS eligible clients referred to the service grows, service needs increase, and fewer applicants are following through on \ntheir Registry application. \nCalifornia Assembly Bill (AB) 283 would transition the collective bargaining for In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) providers from \nthe current county-level system to a statewide model, where the State would be the employer of record. The Budget Act of 2023 \n(Chapter 38, Statutes of 2023) required CDSS to prepare an analysis of the costs and benefits of transitioning IHSS collective \nbargaining from the counties to the State. The required workgroup met throughout 2024 and included representatives from the \nCalifornia State Association of Counties (CSAC), the County Welfare Directors Associations (CWDA), the California Association \nof Public Authorities (CAPA), IHSS provider unions, and IHSS consumers. The report was released in April 2025 and does not \nprovide a recommendation on whether IHSS collective bargaining should transition from counties to the State, but rather includes \na comprehensive analysis of the various fiscal and policy considerations that would be involved in moving bargaining to the State \nlevel. A statewide approach could significantly affect County finances, particularly 1991 Realignment funding and County General \nFund \nCalifornia Advancing and Innovating Medi-Cal (CalAIM) is a State initiative to transform California\u2019s Medi-Cal program. CalAIM \nallows for greater service coordination between Medi-Cal managed care and IHSS by allowing managed care plans to provide \neligible beneficiaries with personal care and home care services while they await IHSS approval, and if needed, provide services \nabove and beyond authorized IHSS service levels.

These include \nCalifornia Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) (see glossary for definition), Refugee Resettlement Program, \nAdoptions Assistance Program (AAP), Foster Care Assistance, General Assistance (GA), Approved Relative Caregiver (ARC), \nWork Incentive Nutritional Supplement (WINS), and State Utility Assistance Subsidy (SUAS). \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nProjecting the cost of Assistance Programs is challenging, given frequent changes in federal and State regulations for eligibility, \nduration, fluctuations in caseloads, assistance program criteria, as well as court decisions and economic conditions. The \nRecommended Budget projections are based on current trends in caseloads. Adjustments, if needed, will be included in the \nFY2025/26 Midyear Financial Report. \nWORKLOAD INDICATORS \nOperational costs associated with assistance payments and relevant workload indicators are included in the H&SS Social Services \nbudget. \nDIVISION BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents increases of $4,923,367 or 6.8% in both revenues and appropriations when compared to \nthe FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. The County General Fund (CGF) contribution of $4,337,626 represents a decrease of $127,570 \nor 2.9%. \nPrimary Funding Sources \nThe primary funding sources are federal entitlement funds, State funds, 1991 and 2011 Realignment (see glossary for definition), \nand County General Fund. Federal funds include Foster Care and Adoptions Assistance (Title IV-E), CalWORKs or Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families (TANF) (see glossary for definitions), and Title XX federal funds. \nBoth Foster Care and Adoptions Assistance programs are also included in 2011 Realignment. The cost to the County General \nFund may increase if sales tax revenues are not sufficient to cover costs the non-federal costs. \nCalWORKs Assistance was realigned from the State to counties with 2011 Realignment differently from other programs. The \nState shifted Proposition 63 \u2013 Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) (see glossary for definition) funding on a one-time basis to fund \nMental Health Programs which were, at that time, funded through 1991 Realignment. The State then shifted the 1991 Mental \nHealth Realignment funds to pay for CalWORKs Assistance costs. \nIn addition, Assembly Bill (AB) 85 (see glossary for definition) changed the 1991 Realignment structure to capture counties\u2019 \nindigent health care savings resulting from California\u2019s election to implement Medi-Cal expansion under the Affordable Care Act, \nand redirect these funds to pay for CalWORKs State General Fund assistance costs, thereby freeing up State General Fund to \npay for the State\u2019s Medi-Cal expansion costs. The State added subaccounts in the 1991 Realignment structure, namely the Family \nSupport Account, funded with 1991 Realignment Sales Tax revenues and the Child Poverty and Family Supplemental Support, \nfunded by Vehicle License Fees. \nTo provide funding for the Child Poverty and Family Supplemental Support subaccount, AB 85 also changed the 1991 Realignment \ngeneral growth formulas, capping general growth for the Health subaccount at 18.45% and eliminating general growth funding for \nSocial Services. The Child Poverty and Family Supplemental Support subaccount is used to fund CalWORKs Assistance grant \nincreases and the repeal of the Maximum Family Grant (MFG) rule (see glossary for definition), effective January 1, 2017. To the \nextent that 1991 Realignment funds resulting from the account structure change do not cover the State\u2019s share of cost for \nCalWORKs, the State is continuing to fund their share from State General Fund; however, there is no backfill for counties should \nthe 18.45% Health subaccount be insufficient to cover counties\u2019 costs \nThe Recommended Budget for Assistance Programs projects a $4,923,367 net increase in revenues compared to the FY2024/25 \nAdopted Budget primarily due to projected cost increases in Adoptions, Kin-Gap, Foster Care, and CalWORKs, offset by a",

The Solano County Board of Supervisors serves as the Governing Board for \nthis separate legal entity. In addition to serving as the Employer of Record for IHSS, the Public Authority also provides services to \nIHSS consumers. \nFUNCTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES \nOn March 5, 2002, the Solano County Board of Supervisors established the Public Authority to act as the Employer of Record for \nIHSS providers. The IHSS Public Authority, a governmental entity separate and distinct from Solano County, established a \nMemorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the County to provide staff and all administrative services for the IHSS PA. \nThis budget unit includes administrative costs incurred by the IHSS PA (BU 1521), IHSS Public Authority Advisory Committee (BU \n1522), health benefit premium payments for IHSS providers (BU 1523), and the IHSS Maintenance of Effort (MOE) - Services (BU \n1523). The required County General Fund Contribution for these functions is budgeted in this fund. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nIHSS PA and SEIU 2015 completed negotiations in 2021, which fixed the IHSS provider wage at $1.20 over the California State \nminimum wage. In January 2025, the California minimum wage increased to $16.50 per hour. As a result of this increase, the \nSolano IHSS wage is fixed at $17.70 per hour. IHSS providers in Solano County who work more than 65 hours per month remain \neligible for a supplemental health plan that includes prescriptions, vision, and dental care paid for by the IHSS PA. \nWORKLOAD INDICATORS \nRelevant workload indicators are incorporated in H&SS Social Services Division\u2019s IHSS Public Authority Bureau (BU 7690). \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents increases of $1,391,108 or 5.9% in both revenues and appropriations when compared to \nthe FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. \nPrimary Funding Sources \nThe primary funding sources are Federal Title XIX (Medi-Cal funding), State General Fund, 1991 Social Services Realignment, \nand County General Fund. \nThe Recommended Budget represents an increase of $1,391,108 or 5.9% in revenues primarily due to the following: \n\u2022 \n$49,997 increase in County General Fund due to increase in IHSS MOE. \n\u2022 \n$731,321 increase in combined State and federal revenues due to increases in projected provider health benefit costs offset \nby a decrease in IHSS administrative revenue \n\u2022 \n$624,198 increase in 1991 Social Services Realignment revenue representing an increase in share of the IHSS MOE funded \nwith 1991 Realignment. \n\u2022 \n$14,408 decrease in Administration Overhead representing a decrease in Countywide Administrative Overhead. \nPrimary Costs \nPrimary costs for IHSS Public Authority are $23,902,519 in Other Charges, $1,001,305 in Operating Transfers-Out, and $12,050 \nin Services and Supplies. \nThe Recommended Budget represents an increase of $1,391,108 in appropriations primarily due to: \n\u2022 \n$696,926 increase in IHSS MOE primarily representing an annualized adjustment in IHSS MOE for the 4% annual inflation \nincrease per SB 80 (2019). \n\u2022 \n$776,001 increase in Individual Providers-IHSS costs representing the projected increase in health premium payments based \non projected provider hours multiplied by $0.55 hourly approved benefit rate.",

The MHSA funding is managed under the Department of Health and Social \nServices, Behavioral Health Division. \nFUNCTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES \nMHSA was established in November 2004 with passage of Statewide Proposition 63 which placed a 1% tax on personal income \nin excess of $1 million and provided the first opportunity in many years for the California Department of Mental Health (DMH) to \nprovide increased funding for personnel and other resources to support county mental health programs and monitor progress \ntoward statewide goals for children, transition age youth, adults, older adults, and families. \nIn March 2024, California voters narrowly passed Proposition 1, the Behavioral Health Services Act (BHSA) which maintains the \n1% income tax on personal income in excess of $1 million and makes significant shifts in how funds are spent and renames the \nMental Health Services Act (MHSA) to the Behavioral Health Services Act (BHSA). The Behavioral Health Services Act (BHSA) \nbecame effective January 1, 2025, with the implementation of changes taking effect in July 2026. \nBHSA continues under the oversight of the Behavioral Health Oversight and Accountability Commission (BHSOAC), now known \nas the \u201cCommission for Behavioral Health\u201d under the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS). Included programs and \nservices will be based upon community specific needs which will include all Behavioral Health funding sources, not just BHSA\u2014\nas identified through a comprehensive community program planning (CPP) process\u2014and intended to address a broad continuum \nof prevention, early intervention and service needs and the necessary infrastructure, technology, and training elements. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nSignificant challenges and accomplishments can be found under BU 7780 \u2013 Fund 902. \nWORKLOAD INDICATORS \nPer WIC \u00a75847 (a) and (b), counties must prepare and submit a Three-Year Program and Expenditure Plan and annual updates \nfor BHSA programs and expenditures to the (BHSOAC) and the (DHCS). Information related to the Three-Year Program and \nExpenditure Plan is included under BU 7780 \u2013 Fund 902. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents a decrease of $3,251,596 or 10.4% in revenues and an increase of $2,194,842 or 5.7% in \nappropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. There is no County General Fund Contribution to this fund. \nMHSA revenues are directly recognized in this fund and transferred to the Health and Social Services Fund (Fund 902) via \nOperating Transfer Outs to reimburse MHSA qualifying expenditures. \nFixed Assets \nNone.",

The State transfers 1.76% of all personal income tax payments to the MHSA fund monthly. \nAn annual adjustment is typically done two years later to reconcile the fund. Depending on the result, the adjustment may be either \npositive or negative against the State MHSA Fund. \nDue to economic conditions in FY2021/22 and FY2022/23, the annual adjustments received in FY2023/24 and FY2024/25 were \nsignificantly higher than previous fiscal years. The annual adjustment expected for FY2025/26 is significantly lower primarily due \nto lower capital gains expected to be realized. Partially offsetting the decrease is an increase in interest income as the fund is \nyielding higher rates of return. \nThe increase of $2,194,842 in appropriations is primarily due to an increase in transfers out to Fund 902 for MHSA program costs \nto balance the draw against anticipated future revenues. \nSUMMARY OF POSITION CHANGES \nThere are no positions allocated to this budget. \nPENDING ISSUES AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS \nIn March 2024, California voters approved Proposition 1, which makes significant revisions to the Mental Health Services Act and \nauthorizes a $6.4 billion bond to finance supportive housing and behavioral health treatment settings. Proposition 1 renames the \nMental Health Services Act to the Behavioral Health Services Act (BHSA), redirects up to 10%, versus 5%, of annual revenues to \nthe State, broadens the eligible uses of funds to include the provision of substance use disorder treatment services, revises the \nBHSA funding categories, and establishes extensive additional oversight, accountability, and sanction provisions. \n \nDETAIL BY REVENUE\nCATEGORY AND\nAPPROPRIATION CATEGORY\n2023/24\n ACTUAL\n2024/25 \nADOPTED\nBUDGET\n2025/26\nRECOMMENDED\nFROM\nADOPTED TO\nRECOMMENDED\nPERCENT\nCHANGE\nREVENUES\nREVENUE FROM USE OF MONEY/PROP\n2,113,036\n1,559,330\n2,148,630\n589,300\n37.8%\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL REV STATE\n37,268,394\n29,559,691\n25,717,695\n(3,841,996)\n(13.0%)\nCHARGES FOR SERVICES\n8\n0\n1,100\n1,100\n100.0%\nTOTAL REVENUES\n39,381,438\n31,119,021\n27,867,425\n(3,251,596)\n(10.4%)\nAPPROPRIATIONS\nOTHER CHARGES\n3,173\n776\n466\n(310)\n(39.9%)\nOTHER FINANCING USES\n32,831,103\n38,295,662\n40,490,814\n2,195,152\n5.7%\nTOTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n32,834,276\n38,296,438\n40,491,280\n2,194,842\n5.7%\nCHANGE IN FUND BALANCE\n(6,547,162)\n7,177,417\n12,623,855\n5,446,438\n75.9%",

The mission of Solano County Public Health \nis to optimize the health of the community through individual- and population-based services which promote health and safety \nthrough prevention and treatment of disease and injury. \nFUNCTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES \nIn November 1988, California voters approved the California Tobacco Health Protection Act of 1988, also known as Proposition \n99. This referendum increased the State cigarette tax by 25 cents per pack and added an equivalent amount on other tobacco \nproducts. A portion of the revenue generated by the tax is deposited in the Health Education Account, which is administered by \nCDPH, CTCP. This program provides funds to 61 Local Lead Agencies, which operate community-based programs to prevent \nand reduce tobacco use. The TPEP is designated as Solano County's Local Lead Agency for tobacco control. \nWith the passage of Proposition 56 in November 2016, California voters approved a $2.00 per pack tax on cigarettes and other \ntobacco products, effective April 1, 2017. This measure provided the Tobacco Prevention and Education Program (TPEP) with \nadditional funding to enhance its comprehensive tobacco control strategy, building upon the existing Proposition 99-funded plan. \nThe increased funding contributed to the implementation of a robust 2017-2021 Tobacco Prevention Plan. However, funding is \nnow declining as anticipated, driven by multiple factors. The $2.00 per pack price increase, coupled with local flavor sales \nrestrictions\u2014most notably Senate Bill (SB) 793, signed into law on August 28, 2020, and later affirmed by voters through \nProposition 31 in the November 8, 2022 statewide ballot\u2014has encouraged many consumers to either quit or reduce their tobacco \nconsumption. \nThe TPEP program embarked on a new three-year plan for 2022-2025, starting January 1, 2022. Subsequently, CDPH extended \nthe plan for an additional two years through June 30, 2027. The following are TPEP\u2019s three current objectives with the goal of \ncompleting by June 30, 2027: \n\u2022 \nCollaborate with youth and youth-serving organizations to recruit, retain, develop and train at least ten youth leaders, \nadvocates, and spokespersons to implement program activities and advance tobacco control efforts. At least 50% of the youth \nwill participate in at least three meetings, trainings, presentations, data collection efforts, and/or tobacco prevention activities. \n\u2022 \nFor at least one jurisdiction in Solano County to adopt and implement a policy prohibiting smoking in outdoor dining spaces, \nbeverage and service areas of restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and mobile catering businesses and their service lines. \n\u2022 \nFor at least one jurisdiction in Solano County to adopt and implement both: 1) a policy that prohibits smoking and vaping of \nall tobacco products in multi-unit housing of two or more units (market-rate, public, and subsidized), including 25 feet from all \ndoors, windows, patios, and balconies, and emphasize a graduated enforcement process; and 2) a policy eliminating the sale \nand/or distribution of any mentholated cigarettes and other flavored tobacco products, and paraphernalia (e.g., smokeless \ntobacco products, dissolvable tobacco products, flavored premium cigars such as little cigars, cigarillos, hookah tobacco, e-\ncigarettes, e-hookah, wrappers). The policy will not criminalize purchase, use, or possession of tobacco products by \nindividuals. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nIn FY2023/24, significant progress was made toward the implementation of a tobacco retail license (TRL) with the City of Vallejo. \nHowever, the ordinance stalled due to local retailer objections. In early FY2024/25, collaborative efforts continued forward with \nmultiple meetings with City of Vallejo staff, advocates, and local retailers to find common ground with the ultimate passage of the \nTRL in December 2024 with a unanimous vote from the Vallejo City Council. This success was a collaborative effort by multiple \ngroups that took the lead and TPEP provided technical assistance. The continued advocacy of youth from Bay Area Community \nResource (BACR) Youth Tobacco-Control Advocacy Policy Program (YTAPP) who testified at Vallejo City Council meetings was \ncritical to the final passage of this ordinance. \nBetween May and July 2024, TPEP recruited six (6) young adult surveyors to attempt purchase of flavored vape products. \nSurveyors visited sixty-eight (68) licensed tobacco retailers in Solano County, fifty-three (53) in Fairfield and fifteen (15) in Suisun \nCity. In total sixteen (16) retailers sold flavored tobacco products that have a flavor characteristic and or flavor in the product name.",

The Project Director has had a meeting with the Fairfield City Manager and is seeking meetings with City \nCouncil members as well as reaching out to the Suisun City Manager and City Council Members. TPEP will share these findings \nwith Fairfield and Suisun City leaders and will continue efforts on the implementation of a TRL policy and for a smoke-free multi-\nunit housing ordinance. \nWORKLOAD INDICATORS \n\u2022 \nIn FY2024/25, a community group of ten individuals representing small business owners and community leaders was \nformed to focus on promoting health and well-being across the local business landscape. The goal is to encourage business \nowners to shift away from selling tobacco, vape/e-cigarette, nicotine-based products and adopt healthier, more sustainable \nalternatives. \n\u2022 \nTobacco-Free Solano Coalition members, along with other volunteers, plan to conduct a smoke-free outdoor dining survey in \nVacaville, Fairfield, Suisun City, Dixon and Rio Vista to see if opinions have changed since the public opinion polls were \nconducted in FY2023/24. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents decreases of $103,187 or 19.5% in revenues and $103,382 or 19.5% in appropriations \nwhen compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. There is no County General Fund contribution to this budget. \nPrimary Funding Sources \nThe primary funding source for Tobacco Prevention and Education Program (TPEP) is the State of California Tobacco Prevention \nand Education Fund Allocation from Proposition 99 and Proposition 56. \nThe Recommended Budget represents a decrease of $103,187 in revenues and is due to a decrease in contracted services \nneeded for the program, therefore reducing the amount of revenue needed. \nPrimary Costs \n\u2022 \nSalaries and Employee Benefits reflect an increase of $5,482 primarily due to an increase in wages, and retirement benefit \ncosts. The increase is partially offset by a decrease health benefit costs and workers\u2019 compensation. \n\u2022 \nServices and Supplies reflect a decrease of $80,350 primarily due to a decrease in contracted services, advertising and \nmarketing and travel expense offset by an increase in liability insurance costs. \n\u2022 \nOther Charges reflect a decrease of $26,979 primarily due to decreases in Public Health personnel staff time for TPEP \nprograms and Countywide Administrative Overhead costs. \n\u2022 \nOther Financing Uses reflect a decrease of $1,535 due to the full redemption of the Pension Obligation Bonds (POBs). \nFixed Assets \nNone. \nDEPARTMENT COMMENTS \nNone.",

This new entity was formed \nfollowing the closure of the non-profit in July 2018 that previously served as the program administrator. The Napa/Solano Area \nAgency on Aging operates via a Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement between Napa and Solano Counties with Solano County, \nas the lead entity, overseeing the Agency\u2019s administration. \nIn 2023, \u201cdesignation\u201d status was awarded to the Aging and Disability Resource Connection (ADRC) of Solano. The ADRC is a \njoint program with Independent Living Resource Center of Contra Costa and Solano Counites. The mandated program integrates \nmultiple resources to create a client focused support system for countywide services. \nThis budget unit includes administrative costs incurred by the AAA (BU 2161) and direct services costs (BU 2162, 2163, and \n2164), and tracks financials for the Napa/Solano Area Agency on Aging (N/S AAA), and the California Department of Aging (CDA). \nThe County General Fund contribution for these functions is budgeted in this fund. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nIn calendar year 2024: \n\u2022 \nThe N/S AAA continued to focus on nutrition services and ensuring that all older adults have access to food. N/S AAA \ncontracted for the preparation and delivery of meal boxes to seniors in low-income areas and with a new provider for \ncongregate meals. Funds were also provided for the upgrade of kitchen equipment used in the production of meals for the \nsenior nutrition program. \n\u2022 \nThe N/S AAA Executive Director continued to co-chair the Data and Outcomes Workgroup of the statewide Aging and \nDisability Resource Connection (ADRC) Advisory Committee. The 19-member committee includes four AAA directors tasked \nwith identifying and implementing strategies to strengthen, sustain, and expand the ADRC and the \u2018No Wrong Door\u2019 model \nthroughout the State. \n\u2022 \nThe N/S AAA Executive Director continued to co-chair the Communications Committee for the California Association of Area \nAgencies on Aging (C4A). The committee is creating a statewide communications strategy and customizable materials for \nlocal AAAs to use in local outreach efforts. \n\u2022 \nThe N/S AAA completed a request for proposal (RFP) for all N/S AAA services. New contracts were awarded for 34 services, \nincluding six new providers of services for congregate meals, friendly calling program, emergency assistance, case \nmanagement, Medicare Improvement for Patients and Providers Act (MIPPA) outreach, and information and assistance \nservices. Under the new contracts, all providers will work with the local ADRC to provide wraparound services for the most \nvulnerable older adults. \n\u2022 \nN/S AAA was asked by CDA to create a new evidence-informed community garden curriculum for the CalFresh Healthy Living \nSNAP-Ed program. The program will be completed in 2025. Once approved, it will be adopted and available statewide for all \nlocal Area Agencies on Aging to use. \n\u2022 \nN/S AAA purchased 900, 4-day emergency packs to distribute to low-income older adults. The Red Cross approved \nbackpacks include food, water tablets, blankets, lights, masks, folding canes, and other items which may be needed in a local \nemergency. The packs are being distributed through N/S AAA service providers and the ADRC. \n\u2022 \nThe Advisory Council to the N/S AAA took on a more active role in community outreach by attending five separate community \ntabling events, giving out resource materials and explaining how to connect with services. Members also attended legislative \nmeetings in Sacramento to support senior legislation.",

The plan outlines the focus areas and services for the next four years and aligns \nwith the statewide Master Plan for Aging. Implementation of the new plan begins in July 2025. \n\u2022 \nN/S AAA continued as the lead project manager for the grant to create a countywide strategy for localizing the statewide \nMaster Plan for Aging. The Local Aging and Disability Action Planning grant program builds on local survey data and includes \nnew community input to present a report for creating a blueprint for incorporating age-friendly focus into planning processes. \nWORKLOAD INDICATORS \n\u2022 \nIn 2024, the N/S AAA created and monitored 68 separate contracts and amendments with 20 different service providers \nsupporting 42 different types of services. This is a 282% increase in types of services being provided compared to 2018 when \nSolano County assumed the role of the Napa/Solano Area Agency on Aging when there were 11 different services being \nprovided and funded. \n\u2022 \nThrough nonprofit service providers, the N/S AAA provided over 175,000 meals to homebound seniors, connected over \n12,000 older and disabled adults to services, made 36,000 phone calls to check on homebound older adults, provided over \n5,000 rides by volunteers, and installed over 650 assistive devices to help reduce falls for 95 individuals. \n\u2022 \nAs the complexity of the N/S AAA program grows along with the needs of Solano County seniors and people with disabilities, \nstaff look for creative ways to expand service delivery to reach more people. In February 2025, three program staff members \nwill be dedicated to the N/S AAA program. \n\u2022 \nIn 2024, the ADRC served an average of 600 clients per month, of which 20% on average needed assistance with Medicare \nbenefits. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget represents decreases of $191,402 or 2.7% in revenues and in appropriations when compared to the \nFY2024/25 Adopted Budget. This Department is primarily comprised of contracted direct services and an Operating Transfers Out \n(Fund 902 \u2013 BU 7685, N/S AAA Administration budget) for the cost of Health and Social Services staff and operating expenditures \nallocated to the administration of the N/S AAA. \nPrimary Funding Sources \nThe primary funding sources for this budget are federal revenues (Titles III B, III C-1, III C-2, III D, III E and VII), State General \nFund, and required match contributions from Napa County and Solano County General Funds. \nThe Recommended Budget includes $6,094,716 in combined federal and State revenues, a contribution of $231,898 from Napa \nCounty and $635,983 in Solano County General Fund, and $20,000 from the Public Health Division. \nThe Recommended Budget represents a decrease of $191,402 in revenues primarily due to: \n\u2022 \nIncrease of $77,896 in combined federal and State revenues (excluding COVID-19 funding) primarily due to an increase in \nfunding from the California Department of Aging. \n\u2022 \nDecrease of $367,828 in COVID-19 Pass-through revenues primarily due to the expiration of various one-time COVID-19 \nrelated funding. \n\u2022 \nDecrease of $21,958 in Other Revenues represents a decrease in Napa County\u2019s share for the overall administration costs \nof N/S AAA. \n\u2022 \nIncrease of $120,488 in Operating Transfers In represents a $120,488 increase in share of Solano County General Fund due \nto the overall increase in the administration costs of N/S AAA. \n\nSummary of Other Administered Budgets 2160 \u2013 Fund 216-Napa/Solano Area Agency on Aging \n \nEmery Cowan, Director of Health & Social Services \n \nHealth & Public Assistance \n \n \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nJ-63 \nPrimary Costs \nThe Recommended Budget includes $6,982,597 in appropriations, a decrease of $191,402 or 2.7% when compared to the \nFY2024/25 Adopted Budget.

HR \nreviewed the work requirements and determined the appropriate classification to be a Project Manager. The Operating Transfers \nIn increase of $120,488 represents an increase for Solano County\u2019s funding share for the Project Manager added in ODAS-AAA \nAdministration (BU 7685). The cost of the position is split in accordance with the program sharing ratios between Napa and Solano \nCounties. \nSUMMARY OF POSITION CHANGES \nThere are no positions allocated to this budget. \nPENDING ISSUES AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS \nThe broad-based CalAIM delivery system creates the potential opportunity for AAAs and senior services organizations to develop \nformal contractual partnerships with Medi-Cal managed care plans.

Some \nservice providers have already declined contracts due to the reporting requirements and future contracts may be in jeopardy if \ndata reporting requirements grow. \nEmergency preparedness for wildfires and power outages will continue to be especially critical for home bound older and disabled \nadults in rural areas. Identifying at-risk individuals and ensuring a support plan is in place for individuals and service providers will \nincrease in importance. \nMany of the priorities included in the statewide Master Plan for Aging are being mandated locally, which includes creating Aging \nand Disability Resource Connections. AAAs are being tasked with reviewing the Master Plan for Aging and localizing initiatives \nand including in local Area Plans with limited support and funding. Staff continues to participate in discussions with the California \nDepartment of Aging and the California Association of Area Agencies on Aging (C4A) to advocate for support, local flexibility, and \nadditional funding. \nLastly, the Solano Master Plan for Aging and Disability report was released in April 2025. The 15-month process to develop the \nplan, funded by a local planning grant received from the California Department of Aging, consisted of 19 community listening \nsessions of over 361 participants. Older adults and adults with disabilities living in Solano County provided their input on what the \nideal age and disability friendly community would look like. The information gathered through the community engagement identified \ntrends that are presented in the Solano Master Plan for Aging and Disability report which is available on the Napa/Solano Area \nAgency on Aging website. The report provides insight into the thoughts and concerns of older adults and adults with disabilities \nliving in Solano County communities.",

First 5 Solano was created as a result of \nProposition 10, approved by California voters in 1998, which \nestablished a dedicated funding source for services for \nchildren ages birth to five utilizing taxes on the sale of tobacco \nproducts. There is a state-level First 5 Commission as well as \n58 county commissions; each county commission operates in \naccordance with a locally approved strategic plan. County \ncommissioners, appointed by local Boards of Supervisors, \nhave sole authority to allocate county commission funds. \nThese funds, which decline over time, cannot be used to \nsupplant existing programs and/or services. First 5 Solano \nprovides funding for community-based services that address \nthe health, well-being, social, cognitive, academic, emotional, \nand developmental needs of expectant parents, young \nchildren, and their families. First 5 Solano also funds activities \nthat promote and support a stronger infrastructure and more \neffective system of services for children from birth to five \nyears of age.

This effort resulted in the creation of a durable framework of desired outcomes with clearly \ndefined indicators to support a process that directs $2 million in General Fund resources toward the highest needs in the county. \nAfter the initial three-year funding cycle which began in 2020, a CIF Planning Group was formed to evaluate progress toward \nmeeting the objectives of the fund, consider new information in each area as the landscape had changed over the last three years, \nand present any modifications that should be made to better improve achieving outcomes within the durable framework. The CIF \nPlanning Group reaffirmed the top priority human services needs in Solano County: \n\u2022 \nPriority Need 1: Mental Health \u2013 Upon consultation with the Mental Health Chief Deputy Director in Health & Social Services, \nthe planning team recommended continuing the overarching community goal to \u201cincrease access to Solano County\u2019s mental \nhealth system of care\u201d with dual strategies of increasing community understanding of how to access mental health services \nand increasing provider understanding of how to respond to residents with mental health needs. \n\u2022 \nPriority Need 2: Affordable Housing \u2013 Since housing is primarily developed within the boundaries of cities, the \nrecommendation is the Board continue investing in the Solano County Housing Trust Fund to increase the supply of affordable \nhousing under the community goal of \u201creducing homelessness.\u201d \n\u2022 \nPriority Need 3: Homelessness \u2013 Upon consultation with CAP Solano Administration (the designee for homelessness issues \nin Solano County) the planning team recommended that the Board continue to support the community goal to \u201creduce \nhomelessness\u201d by addressing prevention services. \n\u2022 \nPriority Needs 4-6: Early Education, Youth Development, Safe and Stable Environments for Children \u2013 While mental health, \nhousing, and homelessness continue to be the highest priorities, early education, youth development, and safe and stable \nenvironments for children were also identified as needs. \nThe Planning Group also reaffirmed the CIF\u2019s three-pronged approach which includes: \n1. \nLegacy Programs\u2014three-year commitment to sustain programs previously funded by the Board to serve a specific \npopulation. \n2. \nDeep Programming\u2014three-year commitment to address the top three priority needs. Community partners are selected \nfollowing the County\u2019s Purchasing Policy, utilizing a competitive process, to implement strategies that were selected as \npart of an outcomes framework to evaluate progress toward the selected needs over time. \n3. \nOne-Time Investments\u2014Smaller annual grants to address the top six priority needs. Community partners are selected \nby a competitive Request for Proposals process. \nThis budget contains $2,775,000 to implement deep programming and $365,000 to implement one-time annual grants. This \nincludes $1,325,000 in matching funds from All Home, and $150,000 in new funding from the Solano Transportation Authority \n(STA). All Home and STA funds are exclusively dedicated for the Keep People Housed Solano program under Deep Programing. \nFunds associated with Legacy Programs are included in the budget units associated with those programs and are not included in \nthis budget unit. \nIn addition to the above, Board of Supervisors established a $250,000 Emergency Fund. This fund will address one-time \nemergency projects for agencies who offer services addressing one or more of the six priority CIF needs. Any established nonprofit \nthat is facing an emergency and needs bridge funding to remain operational in the county can apply to this Emergency Fund. \nThese applications will be considered directly by the Board after a comprehensive application review process is conducted. The \n$250,000 Emergency Fund is only utilized if necessary. \nThis budget unit also includes $207,643 to manage and operate the CIF, which includes one Contract and Programs Manager \nposition and contributions for supervision and overall management of the Community Investment Fund.",

The \ndepartment continues to explore additional ways to minimize costs by streamlining services and programs while striving to maintain \nits quality service level. \nDETAIL BY REVENUE\nAND APPROPRIATION\nPERCENT\nFUNCTIONAL AREA\nCHANGE\nREVENUES\n LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION\n30,095,246\n \n29,985,865\n \n29,574,167\n \n(411,698)\n \n (1.4%)\n PUBLIC SERVICES\n353,533\n \n253,962\n \n247,375\n \n(6,587)\n \n (2.6%)\n SUPPORT SERVICES\n82,113\n \n1,048,897\n \n1,070,773\n \n21,876\n \n2.1%\nTOTAL REVENUES\n30,530,892\n \n31,288,724\n \n30,892,315\n \n(396,409)\n \n (1.3%)\nAPPROPRIATIONS\n LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION\n5,389,338\n \n8,332,890\n \n6,748,785\n \n(1,584,105)\n \n (19.0%)\n PUBLIC SERVICES\n14,234,975\n \n20,003,027\n \n20,564,104\n \n561,077\n \n2.8%\n SUPPORT SERVICES\n6,788,199\n \n8,994,098\n \n8,698,556\n \n(295,542)\n \n (3.3%)\nTOTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n26,412,512\n \n37,330,015\n \n36,011,445\n \n(1,318,570)\n \n (3.5%)\nCHANGE IN FUND BALANCE\n LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION\n(24,705,908)\n \n(21,652,975)\n \n(22,825,382)\n \n(1,172,407)\n \n5.4%\n PUBLIC SERVICES\n13,881,442\n \n19,749,065\n \n20,316,729\n \n567,664\n \n2.9%\n SUPPORT SERVICES\n6,706,086\n \n7,945,201\n \n7,627,783\n \n(317,418)\n \n (4.0%)\nCHANGE IN FUND BALANCE\n(4,118,380)\n \n6,041,291\n \n5,119,130\n \n(922,161)\n \n (15.3%)\nSTAFFING\n LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION\n12\n13\n13\n0\n0.00%\n PUBLIC SERVICES\n97.93\n98.3\n98.3\n0\n0.00%\n SUPPORT SERVICES\n19\n18\n18\n0\n0.00%\nTOTAL STAFFING\n128.93\n129.3\n129.3\n0\n0.00%\nACTUAL\nBUDGET\nRECOMMENDED\nRECOMMENDED\n2024/25\nFROM\n2023/24\nADOPTED\n2025/26\nADOPTED TO\n\n6300 \u2013 Fund 004-Library \nFunctional Area Summary \nSuzanne Olawski, Director of Library Services \nLibrary Services \n \n \n \nK-4 \nCounty of Solano, FY2025/26 Recommended Budget \nThe Recommended Budget represents a net decrease of $396,409 in revenues primarily due to the following: \n\u2022 \nProperty tax revenues of $12,656,949 reflect an increase of $924,129 due to an estimated increase of 3% in assessed values \nfrom the FY2024/25 corrected assessment roll. \n\u2022 \nLibrary sales tax \u2013 Measure B of $6,067,036 reflects a decrease of $173,684 based on estimated statewide decline in retail \nsales. \n\u2022 \nRevenue from Use of Money/Property of $1,188,650 reflects an increase of $854,500 due to an increase in interest income. \n\u2022 \nIntergovernmental Revenues of $370,844 reflect an increase of $23,960 primarily due to an increase in revenue from the \nSolano Partner Libraries and St. Helena (SPLASH) consortium. \n\u2022 \nCharges for Services of $5,800,031 reflect a decrease of $2,213,878 primarily due to a decrease in revenue for library services \nprovided to the Vacaville Library District due to the temporary closure of the Vacaville Cultural Center Library for renovation. \n\u2022 \nOther Financing Sources of $3,461,848 reflect an increase of $193,808 primarily due to an increase in Operating Transfers-\nIn from the four Library Zones based on higher property tax revenue. \n\u2022 \nThe General Fund Contribution to the Library of $386,117 reflects a decrease of $5,244 due to a decrease in the cost of \nemployee benefits for the Director of Library Services position. \nPrimary Costs \nThe Recommended Budget represents a net decrease of $1,318,570 in appropriations primarily due to the following: \n\u2022 \nSalaries and Employee Benefits of $17,783,541 reflect a decrease of $650,430 primarily due to inclusion of anticipated salary \nsavings from vacant positions, offset by an increase in wages and retirement costs. \n\u2022 \nServices and Supplies of $11,873,841 reflect an increase of $709,022 primarily due to increases in costs for library materials, \nsoftware, computer replacements for library staff, utilities, education and training, and meeting room furniture replacement;

The department is the primary point of \naccess for local residents to the resources of the University \nof California. UCCE\u2019s mission is to develop and share \nresearch-based knowledge to assist people in solving \nproblems related to agriculture production, natural resources \nmanagement, youth development, nutrition, and family and \nconsumer sciences. \nBudget Summary: \nFY2024/25 Midyear Projection: \n402,013 \nFY2025/26 Recommended: \n421,110 \nCounty General Fund Contribution: \n421,110 \nPercent County General Fund Supported: \n100% \nTotal Employees (FTEs): \n0 \n \nFUNCTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES \nThe County UCCE program operates through an Interlocal Agreement between the Regents of the UC, Sacramento County, \nSolano County, and Yolo County for a multi-county partnership formed in 2014. Through this agreement, UC provides various \nprograms, including several agricultural, food systems, natural resource and pest management programs, 4-H youth development, \nMaster Gardener, and the Master Food Preserver programs to the County. UCCE\u2019s key functions and responsibilities are to 1) \nassess community and industry needs, 2) develop a research agenda to address those needs, and 3) extend the research-based \ninformation through a variety of educational delivery methods. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nChallenges: \n\u2022 \nUCCE staff in Fairfield were notified in FY2023/24 of the increasing probability of a near-term office move. At this time, a \nfuture location and timing has yet to be determined. Staff will continue to work closely and collaboratively with the County to \nmove this process forward. \n\u2022 \nRecent federal funding cuts are likely to have an impact on UC Agriculture and Natural Resources (ANR), the organizational \numbrella for UCCE, including a partial hiring freeze for new, centrally funded positions not previously within the budget. \nFortunately, UC ANR\u2019s budget is stable and appears able to absorb these cuts without too much impact to programs in \ncounties. At this time, UCCE in Solano does not anticipate any impacts to programs and current recruitments for approved \nadvisor positions will continue as planned.",

The hiring process for \na new Agronomy advisor is also nearing completion. Additionally, UC ANR has approved a new advisor position focused on \nViticulture and Tree Fruit, with recruitment expected to begin in late 2025 or early 2026. \n\u2022 \nIn partnership with the Solano County Farm Bureau, the Climate Smart Agriculture Program provided technical assistance to \nlocal producers for California Department of Food and Agriculture\u2019s (CDFA) Healthy Soils Program (HSP) and State Water \nEfficiency and Enhancement Program (SWEEP) including assisting producers with project designs and online grant \napplications and supporting the on-farm adoption of climate smart agriculture practices. This work was often carried out in \ncollaboration with the Dixon Resource Conservation District (RCD), Solano and Yolo County RCDs, and Community Alliance \nwith Family Farmers. \n\u2022 \nFrom 2024 - 2025, the Climate Smart Agriculture Program supported the implementation of eight CDFA-funded soil health \nprojects and four CDFA-funded irrigation-efficiency projects, leveraging more than $480,000 to support producers in Solano \nCounty. Commonly implemented practices include compost, cover crops, whole orchard recycling, mulching, hedgerow \nplanting, soil moisture sensors, variable frequency drive, pump retrofits, and micro-irrigation systems. \n\u2022 \nThe Orchard Systems program has recently yielded multiple new tools to support walnut growers in the County. Six years of \nresearch has found two plant growth regulators that can help walnuts behave and yield normally despite insufficient winter \nchill hours in light of warming winters. Ten years of research in walnut rootstocks has led to a soon-to-be released rootstock \nthat enables sustained yields in the face of soil-borne pests, thereby decreasing reliance on soil fumigants. Additionally, \nextension and research continue to support responsible water use and improved soil health in Solano County orchards. \n\u2022 \nThe Environmental Horticulture program offered webinars on invasive pests and landscape plant maintenance that were \nattended by landscape professionals, pesticide applicators, arborists, and urban foresters from across Solano County. \nOngoing research on climate-ready trees, tree water requirements, and lawn conversion will provide guidance to help cities \ntransition to more resilient and water-efficient landscapes. \n\u2022 \nResearch and extension by UCCE agricultural advisors related to sustainable pest management strategies in both crop and \nrangeland systems was ongoing. This included continued research with regard to managing broomrape in tomato plants as \nwell as trials to assess efficacy of organic pesticide for control of thrips. Advisors and staff also provided training on best \nmanagement practices for safe pesticide application with a focus on non-English speaking communities. \n\u2022 \nUrban Integrated Pest Management advisors conducted research focused on pests of public health significance and structural \npest control. This included research on the efficacy of organic alternatives to glyphosate as well as education about pests in \nlow-income, multi-unit housing facilities. Trainings have been adapted for online use and are available to pest control \naudiences statewide. Work also continued on invasive pest management training for landscape professionals, retail nurseries, \nand Master Gardener volunteers. An additional focus includes educating landscape and structural pest management \nprofessionals on reducing runoff from the insecticides pyrethroids and fipronil to protect water quality. \n\u2022 \nThe Solano Master Gardener (MG) Program provides science-based information and guidance on home gardening and \nsustainable landscape practices. The program anticipates graduating 12 newly certified volunteers in 2025. During \nFY2024/25, Solano MGs collaborated with Yolo MGs to host 16 joint volunteer training sessions, each serving approximately \n23 participants. \n\u2022 \nThe Master Food Preserver (MFP) program conducted 47 in-person trainings or events on a range of food preservation \nrelated topics and provided over 1,732 individuals with research-based information on safe home food preservation. \nVolunteers contributed 2,793 hours of service during FY2024/25. This includes a new partnership with Grange as well as \nprogramming with 4-H. \n\u2022 \n29 4-H youth participated in the annual Presentation Day/Fashion revue and 28 qualified for Regional Presentation Day. \n\u2022 \nSolano County 4-H partnered with Travis Air Force Base Youth Center to deliver Cooking Academy Curriculum. Teens from \nthe base will be trained to assist with delivering this healthy nutrition program to elementary school students throughout the \nsix lessons.",

The WDB \nBoard of Directors is appointed by the County Board of \nSupervisors and acts as the federally mandated oversight for \nU.S. Department of Labor Workforce Innovation and \nOpportunity Act (WIOA) programs in Solano County. The \nWDB also hosts the Solano-Napa Small Business \nDevelopment Center (SBDC). \nBudget Summary: \nFY2024/25 Midyear Projection: \n9,833,401 \nFY2025/26 Recommended: \n6,695,137 \nCounty General Fund Contribution: \n0 \nPercent County General Fund Supported: \n0% \nTotal Employees (FTEs): \n28 \nFUNCTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES \nThe WDB of Solano County works to build and sustain a skilled workforce, support a vibrant economy, and create a shared \nprosperity for the community of Solano County. The WDB oversees federally funded workforce services through the WIOA on \nbehalf of Solano County, as well as other special projects. Staff members provide tailored job search services, job preparation, \ntraining, and placement services to job seekers, as well as work with local businesses to support both business-specific talent \ndevelopment efforts and industry-wide initiatives. \nJob seeker services are provided through: \n\u2022 \nThe County\u2019s \u201cAmerica\u2019s Job Centers of California\u201d (AJCC) system for One Stop Career Centers that offer free basic job \nsearch services for any job seeker, as well as recruitment events for businesses. \n\u2022 \nWIOA-enrolled services for adult, dislocated workers, and youth jobseekers, including occupational training, job coaching, \nwrap-around service provisions, and job placement assistance. \n\u2022 \nDiscretionary grants serving job seekers and employers, including those through the California Workforce Development Board \n(CWDB), California\u2019s Employment Development Department (EDD), and North Bay regional workforce grants. \n\u2022 \nVarious additional grants and contracts to serve special population groups, employers, or industries are taken on across time, \nas opportunities arise. \n\u2022 \nIn addition, the WDB serves as the host to the Solano-Napa SBDC which provides free business advising and training to \nsmall businesses in Solano County. The Solano-Napa SBDC is supported by Small Business Administration (SBA) funding \nthrough the NorCal SBDC at Cal Poly Humboldt, the Governor\u2019s Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz) \nState match funds, and local support from the cities of Benicia, Fairfield, Napa, Vacaville, and Vallejo. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nThe WDB adapts to changes resulting from federal and State workforce priorities, as well as changing needs within the local and \nState economy and community. These shifts are met through a responsive, data-driven, collaborative effort to best serve the \nneeds of both jobseekers and employers effectively support the talent infrastructure in Solano. \nChallenges: \n\u2022 \nThe WIOA law is in the process of being reauthorized at the federal level. It is unknown whether WIOA will be reauthorized \nby Congress in the coming fiscal year. Discussions in the House Education and Workforce Committee on workforce \ndevelopment indicate that WIOA is likely to be authorized but will have new funding restrictions that could cause significant \nchanges in the public workforce system. \n\u2022 \nFederal and State investments in the public workforce system continue to be inconsistent and difficult to predict from one year \nto the next, as funding levels are partially based on unemployment levels. Funding dedicated to the public workforce system \ncontinues to decrease in general, while the cost of services continues to rise. \n\u2022 \nThe current economic landscape provides significant challenges and unpredictability for Solano\u2019s more vulnerable \ncommunities and businesses. Labor market needs will likely continue to shift in FY2025/26.",

The WDB and SBDC utilized these funds to address COVID-19\u2019s negative \neconomic impacts, while also transforming the current systems to better meet the changing economy. Key workforce projects \nand objectives included investing in community-based workforce initiatives, launching industry-based job training using sector \nstrategy evidence-based practices, and expanding and improving workforce services in disproportionately impacted \ncommunities in Solano County. Key small business projects and objectives include expanding business advising and training \nto small businesses, offering Solano Success accelerator programs coupled with small business grants, and supporting \nbusinesses with talent-related training, translation services, and retention strategies. \n\u2022 \nThe WDB received an international award for 2024 Career Services Organization of the Year from Corporate Wire, based in \nLondon, England. The published article cited the WDB\u2019s work with the bioeconomy and the climate youth work experience \ncurriculum, funded by Solano County, as key factors in the award consideration. \n\u2022 \nThe WDB, in partnership with four community-based organizations, received funding from the California Workforce \nDevelopment Board to help justice-impacted individuals gain self-sustaining employment. In its first year, the WDB, Caminar, \nCenter for Urban Excellence, Mission Samoa, and the Uncuffed Project have supported justice-involved and justice-impacted \nindividuals to gain skills, reduce barriers to employment, and connect with living wage employment opportunities. \nWORKLOAD INDICATORS \n\u2022 \nThe AJCC provided free, basic career services to over 10,000 individuals in FY2023/24 at the Fairfield and Vallejo Job \nCenters, as well as at partner sites throughout the county. \n\u2022 \nIn FY2023/24, the WDB provided intensive career and training services to 183 newly enrolled individuals in WIOA, with 70 \nbeginning receiving training in healthcare, education, construction, transportation and logistics, and manufacturing; and 68 \ngaining employment. \n\u2022 \nBusiness services staff provided talent recruitment and retention assistance to 608 businesses in Solano County in \nFY2023/24. Due to the economic landscape, the WDB focused additional assistance on assisting small business recover \nfrom COVID-19. \n\u2022 \nIn Calendar Year 2024, the Solano-Napa SBDC provided business advising and training to 1,945 small businesses in Solano \nand Napa (1,453 businesses served in Solano County) and held 197 training sessions in English and Spanish. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe Recommended Budget reflects a decrease of $2,427,873 or 27.0% in revenues and a decrease of $3,078,650 or 31.5% in \nappropriations when compared to the FY2024/25 Adopted Budget. \nNo County General Fund dollars are included in this budget. \nPrimary Funding Sources \nThe primary funding source for the WDB is the WIOA local allocation. The funding is based on a formula that includes the \nunemployment rate, number of dislocated workers, and other factors. WIOA funding allocations are not released for the FY2025/26 \nyear until late spring; however, the Department of Labor has released its estimates for next year\u2019s state allocations, and California \nis projected to receive additional WIOA funding in FY2025/26. The current Recommended Budget is based on level funding until \nfinal allocations are released from the State of California Employment Development Department (EDD). However, due to \ncompletion of a State grant in FY2024/25, the Recommended Budget includes $4,345,008 in State revenue, which is 13.7% less \nthan FY2024/25. \nAs a host to the Solano-Napa SBDC, the WDB also receives funding from the NorCal SBDC. The SBDC funding is comprised of \nSmall Business Administration federal funding allocated on a calendar year basis, as well as GO-Biz funding allocated on a federal \nfiscal year basis (October \u2013 September). Therefore, the Recommended Budget is based on anticipated level funding until final \nfunding levels are received from NorCal SBDC. In addition, five cities (Benicia, Fairfield, Napa, Vacaville, and Vallejo) provide a \nlocal match for SBDC services. The Recommended Budget includes $462,766 of SBDC funding which is 2.2% less than \nFY2024/25.",

The SCFA \nstrives to provide a year-round regional destination point by \npresenting first-class, multi-use, entertainment and recreation \nfacilities that support the County Fair and provide an \neconomic and quality of life asset to the greater Solano \nCounty community. \nBudget Summary: \nCY2025: \n3,631,785 \nCounty General Fund Contribution: \n0 \nPercent County General Fund Supported: \n0% \nTotal Employees (FTEs): \n11.7\nFUNCTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES \nThe Solano County Fair Association (SCFA) operates under a contract with the County of Solano. \nSIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS \nChallenges: \n\u2022 \nThe Mobility Hub project will begin construction during FY2025/26, reducing a small area SCFA leased out to provide \nrevenues in support of fair operations. \n\u2022 \nThe State Route 37 (SR-37) project began preconstruction during FY2024/25, requiring a staging area be established and \nreducing usable areas of the fairgrounds for lease. \n\u2022 \nWith the anticipated closure of Golden Gate Fields, it was anticipated the Solano Winner\u2019s Circle (formerly the Race Place) \nwould experience an increase in visitors but this did not materialize and the facility has reduced operations to three days per \nweek. \n\u2022 \nThe Calendar Year forecast for 2024 reflects a net loss of approximately $797,583 resulting in a reduction to the SCFA fund \nbalance. \nSCFA is a non-profit organization in transition; financial challenges, facility needs, and reduced participation in some components \nof the annual fair have required the SCFA to move away from the old fair-centric model to one of a year-round event center focused \non supporting and promoting the community of Solano County. The SCFA Board currently has 11 Directors, (out of 15 appointed \nmembers). SCFA is working on expanding its volunteer base, strengthening the committee structure, and maximizing fundraising \ncapabilities. \nDEPARTMENTAL BUDGET SUMMARY \nThe SCFA budget is based on a calendar year (CY). The CY2025 SCFA Budget reflects total revenues of $3,631,785 an increase \nof $19,710 or 0.5% over the CY2024 Adopted Budget. The CY2025 appropriations total $3,507,987 reflecting a decrease of \n$354,040 or 9.2% when compared to the CY2024 Adopted Budget. \nPrimary Funding Sources \nMost of SCFA\u2019s revenues are generated by the operations of the fairgrounds. The Solano County Fair Association receives a \nsmall allocation of license fees generated by the California horse racing industry to offset a portion of the cost of providing staff \nservices to the SCFA. Revenues include ground leases and revenue from parking, advertising, facility rental, satellite wagering, \nand support from the State of California for the network of fairs. \nFixed Assets \nNone. \nDEPARTMENT COMMENTS \nThe 2025 Solano County Fair will take place Thursday, June 12, 2025 through Sunday, June 15, 2025. The 2025 Fair theme is \n\u201cFun for the Whole Herd\u201d and is planned to be an onsite traditional format.",
