Any land use development permit or other permit which conforms with the provisions of this Section may serve as a marsh development permit, as determined by the Director of Resource Management. If all or a portion of the site or development is within the Primary Management Area, any required County land use or development permit shall be obtained prior to application for a marsh development permit from the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission for development within the Primary Management Area, unless that Commission has delegated its permit authority as described in section <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PRC&amp;sectionNum=29501" target="_top">29501</a> of the Public Resources Code.

		  <p class="P0">This Chapter may be amended by changing the boundaries of districts or by changing any other provision thereof whenever the public necessity and convenience and the general welfare require such amendment by following the procedure of this Section.</p>

		  <p class="P1"><span class="bold">A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="boldunderline">Initiation</span>. An amendment may be initiated by:</p>

		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One or more owners of property to be affected by the proposed amendment, upon a verified petition filed with the Department of Resource Management, accompanied by a fee or fees as may be set by the Board of Supervisors by resolution pursuant to Section <a rel="cgi/extract.pl?page=html/SolanoCounty1100.html&amp;anchor=11-111" href="/CA/SolanoCounty/#!/SolanoCounty1100.html#11-111" class="basic">11-111</a> of this Code. No part of such fee shall be refundable.</p>

		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>By the Director of Resource Management as the Director deems necessary, or at the direction of the Planning Commission or the Board of Supervisors.</p>

		  <p class="P1"><span class="bold">B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="boldunderline">Public Hearings</span>.</p>

		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on any proposed amendment that changes any property from one zone to another or imposes, modifies, or removes any regulation which affects the permitted uses of real property, including land, buildings, signs and other structures.</p>

		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Notice of the hearing shall be given pursuant to Section <a rel="cgi/extract.pl?page=html/SolanoCounty2800/SolanoCounty2801.html&amp;anchor=28.04" href="/CA/SolanoCounty/#!/SolanoCounty2800/SolanoCounty2801.html#28.04" class="basic">28.04</a>. After conclusion of its hearing, the Planning Commission shall render its decision by recommending approval, approval with modifications, or disapproval of the proposed amendment. The recommendation shall include the reasons for the recommendation, and shall describe the relationship of the proposed amendment to the General Plan and any applicable specific plan. The Planning Commission shall file with the Board of Supervisors an attested copy of a report of its recommendations within 90 days after the conclusion of the public hearings.</p>

		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Upon receipt of such report from the Planning Commission the Board of Supervisors shall set the matter for public hearing and shall give notice thereof pursuant to Section <a rel="cgi/extract.pl?page=html/SolanoCounty2800/SolanoCounty2801.html&amp;anchor=28.04" href="/CA/SolanoCounty/#!/SolanoCounty2800/SolanoCounty2801.html#28.04" class="basic">28.04</a> and to the same persons and organizations who were given notice of the Planning Commission hearing. After conclusion of its hearing, the Board of Supervisors may enact the proposed amendment or any part thereof in such form as the Board may deem advisable to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare of the County, or it may deny the proposed amendment. Prior to enacting any alternative to the proposed amendment that was not previously considered by the Planning Commission during its hearing, the Board shall first refer the alternative to the Planning Commission for report and recommendation. The Planning Commission is not required to hold a public hearing or issue a report and recommendation on the alternative. Failure of the Planning Commission to issue a report and recommendation within 60 days after the Board makes its referral shall be deemed to be a positive recommendation on the alternative. However, if the proposal requests only that property be rezoned from one zoning district to another and the Planning Commission has recommended disapproval of the proposal, then the Board of Supervisors is not required to take any further action on the proposal unless an interested person requests a hearing by filing a written request with the Clerk of the Board within 10 days after the Planning Commission files its recommendation with the Board. If no request for hearing is timely filed or if the Board does not initiate review as described in Section <a rel="cgi/extract.pl?page=html/SolanoCounty2800/SolanoCounty2805.html&amp;anchor=28.112" href="/CA/SolanoCounty/#!/SolanoCounty2800/SolanoCounty2805.html#28.112" class="basic">28.112</a>(F), then the proposal shall be deemed denied 10 days after the Planning Commission files its recommendation with the Board.</p>

		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Upon the consent of the Planning Commission, any petition for an amendment may be withdrawn upon the written request of a majority of all persons who signed the petition. The Board of Supervisors or the Planning Commission, as the case may be, may, by resolution, abandon any proceedings for an amendment initiated by its own direction; provided, that such abandonment may be made only when such proceedings are before such body for consideration; and provided further, that any hearing of which public notice has been given shall be held.</p>

		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Whenever a petition for an amendment to this chapter has been denied, no new petition for the same amendment shall be accepted by the Department for a period of one year from the effective date of the final denial of the original petition; provided, that upon a showing of a substantial change of circumstances, the Director of Resource Management may permit the filing of such new petition prior to the expiration of such one-year period. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Supervisors or Planning Commission from at any time initiating any proceedings which either of such bodies may initiate pursuant to this section.</p>

		  <p class="P1"><span class="bold">A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="boldunderline">Purpose</span>. The purpose of this section is to establish uniform provisions for the regulation of nonconforming structures, and uses of land that were legally established before the amendment, of this Chapter, or previously adopted County ordinances, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted differently under the current provisions of this Chapter or future amendments.</p>

		  <p class="P1"><span class="bold">B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="boldunderline">Intent</span>. It is the intent of this Chapter to:</p>

		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Discourage the long-term continuance of these nonconformities, providing for their eventual elimination, but to permit them to exist under the limited conditions outlined in this section.</p>

		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Prevent nonconforming uses and structures from being enlarged, expanded, or extended, or being used as justification for adding other structures or uses that are prohibited by the provisions of this Chapter applicable to the zoning district in which the nonconformity is located.</p>

		  <p class="P1"><span class="bold">C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="boldunderline">Continuance of Existing Nonconforming Uses</span>. An ongoing use of land or buildings lawfully established and existing prior to the adoption of any provision of this Chapter that renders such use nonconforming with the regulations currently specified by this Chapter for the district in which such land is located, may be continued; provided, that no such use shall be enlarged or increased, nor be extended to occupy a greater area than that occupied by such use at the time such use was rendered nonconforming; and provided further, that if such use ceases as hereinafter provided, the subsequent use of such land shall be in conformity to the regulations specified by this Chapter for the district in which such land is located.</p>

		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repairs and Maintenance.</span> Except as may be provided in 28.114(H) below, ordinary maintenance and repairs may be made to any nonconforming structure or building; provided that, no structural alterations are made except those required by law or ordinance; and provided further, such work does not exceed twenty-five percent of the actual value of the structure or building in any one-year period.</p>

		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destruction and Reconstruction.</span> Except as may be provided in 28.114H below, if at any time a building in existence prior to an amendment to this Chapter which does not conform to the regulations, including parking regulations for the district in which it is located, is damaged or destroyed by fire or other natural hazard, explosion, act of God, or act of the public enemy, to the extent of more than sixty percent of the actual value of the structure or building according to the assessment by the County assessor for the fiscal year during which such destruction occurs, the land and building shall be subject to all the regulations specified by this Chapter for the district in which such land and building are located.</p>

		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expansion.</span> Except as provided in 28.114(H) below, a non-conforming use of the land or structure shall not be permitted to expand.</p>

		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Structural Alterations.</span> Except as provided in 28.114(H) below, a non-conforming use of the land or structure shall not be permitted to make structural alterations.</p>

		  <p class="P1"><span class="bold">D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="boldunderline">Nonconforming Lots</span>.
