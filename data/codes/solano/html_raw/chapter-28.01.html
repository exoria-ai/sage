		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">2.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words “shall,” “will,” “is to,” and “are to” are mandatory. “Should” means a regulation that is not mandatory but must be either fulfilled or the applicant must demonstrate an alternative that fulfills the intent of the regulation. “May” is permissive.</p>

		  <p class="P1"><span class="bold">B.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="boldunderline">Unlisted Land Uses</span>. If an owner proposes a type of land use which is not described or identified in this chapter, the Zoning Administrator may determine that the proposed use is substantially similar to another type of land use which is described or identified in this chapter, and the permit application shall be accepted and processed for proposed use as if it were functionally equivalent to the substantially similar land use. If a use permit or other discretionary approval of the Planning Commission is required by this chapter for the substantially similar land use, the Planning Commission is not bound by the Zoning Administrator’s determination.</p>
