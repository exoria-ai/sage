		  <p class="P2">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cottage Industries</p>

		  <p class="P3"><span class="bold">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose of Regulations. </span>These cottage industry regulations provide for the accessory use of a dwelling or accessory building(s) on the same parcel as the dwelling for gainful employment involving limited amounts of manufacturing or sales of goods or services. The use must be clearly incidental and secondary to the use of the premises for residential purposes and must not change or adversely affect the residential or rural character of the property or its surroundings.</p>

		  <p class="P3"><span class="bold">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Types of Cottage Industries. </span>There are two classes of cottage industry: cottage industry – limited, and cottage industry – general.</p>

		  <p class="P3"><span class="bold">c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use Permit Required. </span>Cottage industries may be permitted in zoning districts as specified in this chapter upon issuance of a use permit. A business license is first secured pursuant to Chapter <a href="/CA/SolanoCounty/#!/SolanoCounty2800/SolanoCounty2803.html#14" rel="cgi/extract.pl?page=html/SolanoCounty2800/SolanoCounty2803.html&amp;anchor=14" class="basic">14</a> prior to operation of a cottage industry.</p>

		  <p class="P3block">A use permit for a cottage industry may be granted for an unlimited period of years, unless the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission determines that a shorter period is more appropriate to ensure conformance with the intent and standards of this section or other applicable requirements.</p>

		  <p class="P3block">The Zoning Administrator shall be the hearing authority for cottage industry – limited permits and the Planning Commission shall be the hearing authority for cottage industry – general use permits.</p>

		  <p class="P3"><span class="bold">d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Requirements for All Cottage Industries</span></p>

		  <p class="P4"><span class="bold">(1)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cottage industry shall be clearly incidental and subordinate to the use of the premises for residential purposes.

Any accessory building used for a cottage industry must comply with applicable building codes.</p>

		  <p class="P4"><span class="bold">(7)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No equipment or process used in the cottage industry shall create noise, vibration, glare, fumes, dust, odors, smoke, electrical interference or other impacts in excess of those customarily generated by single-family residential uses in the neighborhood. The Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission may impose performance standards to address these requirements. Performance standards may include additional setbacks to property lines, screening, soundproofing, restricted hours of operation, or other measures that mitigate the impacts of the business.</p>

		  <p class="P4"><span class="bold">(8)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No land or building shall be used or occupied in any manner so as to create any dangerous, injurious, noxious or otherwise objectionable fire, explosive or other hazard; noise or vibration; smoke, dust, odor, or other form of air pollution; heat, cold, dampness; radioactivity, electrical or other disturbances; glare; liquid or solid refuse or wastes; or other substances, condition or element referred to herein as dangerous or objectionable elements in such a manner or in such amount as to adversely affect the surrounding area or adjoining premises.</p>

		  <p class="P4"><span class="bold">(9)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant shall submit plans and a complete statement of any proposed machinery, processes and products, and specifications or standards for the mechanisms and techniques to be used in obviating the emission of dangerous and objectionable elements.</p>

		  <p class="P4"><span class="bold">(4)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A maximum 500-square-foot area may be devoted to retail sales. Retail sales are only allowed on site when the merchandise sold was produced by the operator of the cottage industry or is incidental to a service provided by the operator. Businesses that purchase goods wholesale may store those goods on the property, but may not conduct retail sales on the property; such transactions must occur by telephone, online, and by mail. Not more than three delivery vehicles shall access the premises each day.</p>

		  <p class="P4"><span class="bold">(7)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any other use that is not incidental to the residential use of the property or is not compatible with the residential character of the neighborhood.</p>

		  <p class="P2">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home Occupations</p>

		  <p class="P3"><span class="bold">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purpose of Regulations. </span>These home occupation regulations provide for the accessory use of a dwelling or accessory building(s) on the same parcel as the dwelling for gainful employment involving the manufacture, provision, or sale of goods and/or services. The use must be clearly incidental and secondary to the use of the premises for residential purposes and must not change or adversely affect the residential or rural character of the property or its surroundings. A use permit is not required to conduct a home occupation; however, such use shall be subject to all conditions of this chapter generally, such as off-street parking, and all other permits required under County code, such as building permits and business licenses.</p>

		  <p class="P3block">Home occupations may be allowed in any district allowing a residential dwelling, provided a business license is first secured pursuant to Chapter <a href="/CA/SolanoCounty/#!/SolanoCounty2800/SolanoCounty2803.html#14" rel="cgi/extract.pl?page=html/SolanoCounty2800/SolanoCounty2803.html&amp;anchor=14" class="basic">14</a>.

		  <p class="P3"><span class="bold">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Types of Home Occupations. </span>There are two types of home occupations, as follows: Type I Home Occupation, and Type II Home Occupation.</p>

		  <p class="P3"><span class="bold">c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type I Home Occupations. </span>Type I Home Occupations are service-type businesses which require a home office and may require storage of supplies utilized in the business. A Type I Home Occupation requires a business license prior to commencing operations. Type I Home Occupations must comply with the following standards:</p>

		  <p class="P3block"><span class="bold">General standards – Type I Home Occupations</span></p>

		  <p class="P4"><span class="bold">(1)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The particular uses conducted as a Type I Home Occupation, and their operation and appearance, shall not change or disturb the residential or rural character of the premises or its surroundings.</p>

		  <p class="P4"><span class="bold">(2)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The home occupation shall be clearly incidental and subordinate to the use of the premises for residential purposes. All aspects of the home occupation, including storage, shall be conducted entirely within the dwelling unit or enclosed accessory building(s) on the premises. The square footage allocations are as follows:</p>

		  <p class="P5"><span class="bold">i.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total area used for the home occupation, exclusive of incidental storage, shall not exceed 400 square feet of the habitable floor area of the dwelling. The home occupation may be conducted within a detached building otherwise allowed by zoning and in compliance with applicable building codes, as long as its square footage does not exceed 400 square feet.</p>

		  <p class="P5"><span class="bold">ii.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidental storage in an accessory structure not exceeding 120 square feet shall be allowed.</p>

		  <p class="P4"><span class="bold">(3)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There shall be no merchandise offered for sale, except that produced on the premises. Internet-based businesses that do not involve the storage of product on site are exempt from this requirement.</p>

		  <p class="P4"><span class="bold">(4)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No person other than members of the family residing on the premises shall be engaged in the home occupation.</p>

		  <p class="P4"><span class="bold">(5)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No clients or customers shall come onto the property in conjunction with the business.</p>

		  <p class="P4"><span class="bold">(6)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use shall not generate traffic in excess of that normally associated with the residential use. Heavy commercial vehicles shall not be used in the home occupation for delivery of materials to or from the premises.</p>

		  <p class="P4"><span class="bold">(7)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more than one vehicle or truck with a maximum one-ton capacity and one trailer shall be permitted on the site in conjunction with any home occupation.</p>

		  <p class="P4"><span class="bold">(8)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No mechanical or electrical equipment shall be employed other than machinery or equipment typical of the type or specifications used in a hobby or a vocation customarily conducted within the confines of a dwelling unit.</p>

		  <p class="P4"><span class="bold">(9)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use shall not generate noise, odor, dust, glare, vibration or electrical interference to neighboring properties, or constitute a nuisance, or be detrimental to the health, safety, peace, morals, comfort or general welfare of the public.</p>

		  <p class="P3"><span class="bold">d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type II Home Occupations. </span>Type II Home Occupations may involve retail sales of merchandise and service type businesses which require a home office and may require storage of supplies utilized in the business as well as inventories of merchandise. A Type II Home Occupation requires both a business license and a home occupation permit prior to commencing operations. Type II Home Occupations must meet the following standards:</p>

		  <p class="P3block"><span class="bold">General standards – Type II Home Occupations</span></p>

		  <p class="P4"><span class="bold">(1)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The particular uses conducted as a Type II Home Occupation, and their operation and appearance, shall not change or disturb the residential or rural character of the premises or its surroundings.</p>

		  <p class="P4"><span class="bold">(2)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The home occupation shall not result in any change in the outside appearance of the building or premises, or other visible evidence of the conduct of such occupation, other than one nonilluminated sign not exceeding two square feet.</p>

		  <p class="P4"><span class="bold">(3)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The home occupation shall be clearly incidental and subordinate to the use of the premises for residential purposes. All aspects of the home occupation, including storage, shall be conducted entirely within the dwelling unit or enclosed accessory building(s) on the premises. The square footage allocations are as follows:</p>

		  <p class="P5"><span class="bold">i.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total area used for the home occupation, exclusive of incidental storage, shall not exceed 640 square feet of the habitable floor area of the dwelling. The home occupation may be conducted within a detached building otherwise allowed by zoning and in compliance with applicable building codes, as long as its square footage does not exceed 640 square feet.</p>

		  <p class="P5"><span class="bold">ii.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidental storage in an accessory structure not exceeding 120 square feet shall be allowed.</p>

		  <p class="P5"><span class="bold">iii.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidental storage in the required enclosed two-car garage shall be permissible; provided, that two cars can still be parked in the garage.</p>

		  <p class="P4"><span class="bold">(4)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sale of merchandise not produced on the premises (except mail order and internet-based businesses) shall be incidental and accessory to the merchandise or service produced by the home occupation.</p>

		  <p class="P4"><span class="bold">(5)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No person other than members of the family residing on the premises shall be engaged in the home occupation; provided, however, that one employee shall be permitted when the property on which the home occupation is located is a minimum of two net acres in size.</p>

		  <p class="P4"><span class="bold">(6)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not more than 10 customers or clients shall come to the premises during any one day, restricted to the hours 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Not more than three delivery vehicles shall access the premises each day. Businesses shall operate Mondays through Saturdays. Businesses receiving clients on the property shall provide one additional on-site parking space beyond those required for any dwellings located on the property.</p>

		  <p class="P4"><span class="bold">(7)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use shall not generate traffic in excess of that normally associated with the residential use. Heavy commercial vehicles shall not be used in the home occupation for delivery of materials to or from the premises.</p>

		  <p class="P4"><span class="bold">(8)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more than one vehicle or truck and one trailer per truck with a maximum one-ton capacity shall be permitted in conjunction with any home occupation.</p>

		  <p class="P4"><span class="bold">(9)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No mechanical or electrical equipment shall be employed other than machinery or equipment typical of the type or specifications used in a hobby or a vocation customarily conducted within the confines of the dwelling unit.</p>

		  <p class="P4"><span class="bold">(10)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use shall not generate noise, odor, dust, glare, vibration or electrical interference to neighboring properties, or constitute a nuisance, or be detrimental to the health, safety, peace, morals, comfort or general welfare of the public.</p>

		  <p class="P2">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rural Resident Enterprise. Rural resident enterprises may be allowed in the Suisun Marsh Agricultural (A-SM) Districts upon securing a land use permit, provided the conditions of this section and all other provisions of this chapter have been or will be met. It is the intent of this section that such uses be limited to small-scale home business activities which are clearly secondary to residential use of the property, do not conflict with the rural character of surrounding properties, or create impacts associated with commercial and industrial uses. Rural resident enterprises are uses which clearly do not compete with commercially or industrially zoned properties and are not likely to expand.</p>

		  <p class="P3"><span class="bold">a.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uses shall not exceed a total area of 1,500 square feet of contiguous indoor or outdoor space of which a maximum of 500 square feet may be devoted to retail sales or services directly involving customers.</p>

		  <p class="P3"><span class="bold">b.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enterprises shall be operated by the resident family only, and there shall not be more than one nonresident employee on site.</p>

		  <p class="P3"><span class="bold">c.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uses shall not be allowed which generate significant amounts of traffic. A permit on a private road which involves an increase in traffic may be approved by the Planning Commission only after evidence is shown that the proposed use will not unduly burden adjacent property owners on the private road.</p>

		  <p class="P3"><span class="bold">d.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uses which generate traffic beyond that normally associated with rural areas or which may have impacts associated with increased lighting or noise shall be limited to daytime hours.</p>

		  <p class="P3"><span class="bold">e.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enterprises shall remain secondary to the residential use of the property and shall be located behind the front building line of the residence, and a minimum of 20 feet from side property lines and 25 feet from rear property lines.</p>

		  <p class="P3"><span class="bold">f.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When enterprises are to be contained within a building or area exceeding the allowable size limitations, that area to be used for the enterprise shall be physically separated from the remaining area and in no case shall an existing garage be converted to a rural resident enterprise unless additional enclosed parking is provided in conformance with the County’s parking standards.</p>

		  <p class="P3"><span class="bold">g.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Signs shall be limited to one nonilluminated name plate not to exceed 20 square feet mounted on or directly adjacent to the residence or proposed use. No advertising signs shall be permitted.</p>

		  <p class="P3"><span class="bold">h.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Areas dedicated to outside storage or use shall be adequately screened or fenced so as not to have a visual impact on neighboring properties.</p>

		  <p class="P3"><span class="bold">i.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adequate parking shall be provided as determined necessary by the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission. Access to the enterprise shall be limited to the existing residential driveway.</p>

		  <p class="P1"><span class="bold">A.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="boldunderline">Purpose</span>. Battery energy storage system regulations are adopted with the intent of advancing and protecting the public health, safety, and welfare of the community by establishing regulations for the installation and use of BESS. The regulations herein are intended to protect the health, safety, welfare, and quality of life for the general public, to ensure compatible land uses in the areas affected by energy storage facilities, and to mitigate the impacts of energy storage facilities on the environment.</p>

		  <p class="P1"><span class="bold">B.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="boldunderline">Definitions</span>.</p>

		  <p class="P0"><span class="boldunderline">Behind-the-meter (BTM) battery energy storage system</span>. Refers to a battery energy storage system (BESS) installed on the customer’s side of the utility meter. These systems are designed to support energy use by providing backup power, demand charge management, load shifting, or renewable energy integration.</p>

		  <p class="P0"><span class="boldunderline">Commissioning</span>. A systematic process that provides documented confirmation that a battery energy storage system functions according to the intended design criteria and complies with applicable code requirements.</p>

		  <p class="P0"><span class="boldunderline">Decommissioning</span>. The process of removing equipment and other infrastructure associated with a project and restoring the site for viable reuse consistent with the zoning district.</p>

		  <p class="P0"><span class="boldunderline">Front-of-the-meter (FTM) battery energy storage system</span>. Refers to a battery energy storage system (BESS) that is directly connected to the transmission or distribution grid and primarily serves wholesale market functions such as grid support, frequency regulation, or energy arbitrage.</p>

		  <p class="P0"><span class="boldunderline">IEEE</span>. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers is a global professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity. IEEE develops and maintains international standards in various fields of electrical and electronic engineering, computer science, and related disciplines.</p>

		  <p class="P0"><span class="boldunderline">National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)</span><span class="boldunderline">.</span> A nonprofit organization that develops and publishes consensus codes and standards intended to minimize the risk and effects of fire by establishing criteria for building, processing, design, service, and installation in the United States and internationally.</p>

		  <p class="P0"><span class="boldunderline">NFPA 855</span>. The Standard for the Installation of Stationary Energy Storage Systems is a set of comprehensive guidelines for the safe installation of stationary energy storage systems, including those with lithium batteries. These standards address various aspects of installation to mitigate fire and explosion risks associated with energy storage technologies. It covers topics such as system design, construction, operation, and maintenance to ensure safety and reliability.</p>

		  <p class="P0"><span class="boldunderline">Thermal runaway</span>. Refers to an uncontrollable, self-sustaining exothermic chain reaction within a battery energy storage system, initiated by a failure mechanism (e.g., internal short circuit, overcharging, physical damage, or thermal exposure). This reaction results in a rapid increase in cell temperature, leading to the release of flammable electrolytes, generation of toxic gases (e.g., hydrogen fluoride, carbon monoxide), and potential cascading failures to adjacent cells. If unmitigated, thermal runaway may cause fire, explosion, or hazardous material release, posing risks to public safety, property, and the environment.</p>

		  <p class="P0"><span class="boldunderline">UL 9540</span>. A standard for energy storage systems and equipment, designed to ensure the safety of these systems and covers their construction, performance, and testing requirements.
