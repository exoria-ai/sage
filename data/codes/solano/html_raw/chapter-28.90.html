	<h3 class="Cite" id="28.91.10"><a name="28.91.10">28.91.10</a> Purpose</h3>

		  <p class="P0">The purpose of architectural approval is to promote the orderly and harmonious development of the County, the stability of land values and investments, and the general welfare; and to help prevent the impairment or depreciation of land values and development by the erection of structures or additions or alterations thereto of unsightly, undesirable, or obnoxious appearance. A building permit shall not be issued until architectural approval has been obtained.</p>

	<h3 class="Cite" id="28.91.20"><a name="28.91.20">28.91.20</a> Applicability</h3>

		  <p class="P0">The provisions of this Section shall apply to all zoning districts.</p>

	<h3 class="Cite" id="28.91.30"><a name="28.91.30">28.91.30</a> Architectural Standards</h3>

		  <p class="P0">In carrying out the purposes of this Section, the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission shall keep in mind the following standards:</p>

		  <p class="P1"><span class="bold">A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is not a purpose of this Section that control of architectural character should be so rigidly enforced that individual initiative is stifled in the design of any particular building or substantial additional expense incurred; rather, it is the intent of this Section that any control exercised be the minimum necessary to achieve the overall objectives of this Section.</p>

		  <p class="P1"><span class="bold">B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Good architectural character is based upon the suitability of a building for its purposes, upon the appropriate use of sound materials, and upon the principles of harmony and proportion in the elements of the building.</p>

		  <p class="P1"><span class="bold">C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Good architectural character is not in itself more expensive than poor architectural character, and is not dependent upon the particular style of architecture selected.</p>

		  <p class="P1"><span class="bold">D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Where buildings are grouped in close proximity, harmony between individual buildings in any group is of equal importance to the architectural character of any individual building. Similarity of materials, of colors, of landscaping, or character of construction, will help to minimize disharmony between buildings in proximity.</p>

		  <p class="P1"><span class="bold">E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The aesthetic quality of building design, as evidenced by the use and relationship of materials, color and texture, application of the principles of scale, proportion and harmony, and suitability of structure to its site, shall be comparable to that exhibited in the surrounding area.</p>

		  <p class="P1"><span class="bold">F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>New dwellings shall maintain design continuity, conform to or be aesthetically compatible in areas where a particular design style or theme has been established.</p>

	<h3 class="Cite" id="28.91.40"><a name="28.91.40">28.91.40</a> Other Requirements</h3>

		  <p class="P1"><span class="bold">A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In carrying out the purposes of this Section, the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission shall pay particular attention to on-site signs and general advertising structures, and shall have authority to limit and control the location, number, size, design, lighting, and use of colors and such on-site signs and general advertising structures in order to promote the orderly and harmonious development of the commercial and industrial districts of the County.</p>

		  <p class="P1"><span class="bold">B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When determining the compatibility of locating a dwelling amidst or adjacent to existing residential structures, additional consideration shall be given to the minimum development standards for dwellings found in Section <a rel="cgi/extract.pl?page=html/SolanoCounty2800/SolanoCounty2803.html&amp;anchor=28.72.10" href="/CA/SolanoCounty/#!/SolanoCounty2800/SolanoCounty2803.html#28.72.10" class="basic">28.72.10</a>(A)(1), existing architecture, and use of exterior materials used on structures in the immediate neighborhood.</p>

		  <p class="P1"><span class="bold">A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="boldunderline">Establishment of building lines</span>. For the purpose of assuring the proper right-of-way width of certain streets or highways designated by the General Plan to be of major importance, building lines measured from the centerline of such streets or highways may be established on the zoning maps of this Chapter such building lines, when established, shall supersede the front yard requirements of this Chapter.</p>

		  <p class="P1"><span class="bold">B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="boldunderline">Effect of establishment of building lines</span>. In no case shall any building be hereafter erected, nor shall any use of land be conducted, except the use of land for agriculture, so that such use will be closer to the right-of-way line or any building line which is established for such street or road by this Chapter or any provision of this code or any ordinance of the County.</p>

		  <p class="P1"><span class="bold">C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="boldunderline">Building site special provisions</span>.</p>

		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The use of land as permitted for the district in which it is located shall be permitted on a building site of less area or frontage than that required by the regulations for such district; provided, that such is shown as a lot on a subdivision map of record, or is a parcel of land which was under one ownership on January 29, 1959; provided, that in either case the owner of such lot shall not have owned or purchased any adjoining property since January 29, 1959. For the purpose of this Section, adjoining property shall be deemed to include any parcels which are physically separated by roads, streets, utility easements and railroad right-of-way.</p>

		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A building site shall have its principal frontage on a public or private street; however, for a private street serving more than three building sites, the right-of-way width opening from the public street and along the full length of the private street shall be at least fifty feet.</p>

		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In any A or R-R District the area bounded by the centerline of the public or private road right-of-way on which the parcel fronts, and the parcel sidelines extended to such right-of-way centerline may be included in the computation of the minimum parcel area requirement.</p>

		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A legally established conforming use may be enlarged, provided the added portions conform to yard, building, location and height requirements, and such additions do not encroach upon any required parking space.</p>

		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In any district where one-family dwellings are an allowed use, the Zoning Administrator may authorize an owner to replace an existing dwelling on a developed parcel with a new one-family dwelling and permit occupancy of the existing dwelling for the term of construction of the replacement dwelling or authorize a temporary deferral to complete a zoning requirement to issue a building permit or Certificate of Occupancy; provided that:</p>

		  <p class="P3"><span class="bold">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The replacement dwelling shall comply in all respects with yard, building, location, height and parking space requirements of this Chapter.</p>

		  <p class="P3"><span class="bold">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The owner executes a written agreement with the County guaranteeing the demolition and removal of the existing dwelling or timely completion of a specified zoning requirement. The owner shall, upon execution of the agreement, deliver to the County a Certificate of Deposit, faithful performance bond with an insurance company authorized to do business in the State, or make a cash deposit with the Treasurer of the County in the amount of money provided for in the agreement. The certificate, bond or cash deposit shall be in such amount as will be sufficient to accomplish such demolition and removal by the owner upon completion of the replacement dwelling or by the County or comply with the zoning requirement in case the agreement is breached by the owner. The decision of the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission as to the amount of deposit required shall be final. The owner shall, in the agreement, consent to agents and employees of the County entering upon his land and demolishing and removing existing dwelling if owner fails to remove such dwelling or verify compliance with the zoning requirement as stipulated in the agreement.</p>

		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The minimum parcel area requirement of the zoning district wherein certain uses may be permitted, subject to the securing of a use permit in each case, may be reduced, provided such use is determined to be any of the following:</p>

		  <p class="P3"><span class="bold">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Public service facility;</p>

		  <p class="P3"><span class="bold">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Crematory, mausoleum or columbarium;</p>

		  <p class="P1"><span class="bold">A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="boldunderline">Applicability</span>. No land or building in any district shall be used or occupied in any manner so as to create any dangerous, injurious, noxious or otherwise objectionable fire, explosive or other hazard; noise or vibration; smoke, dust, odor, or other form of air pollution; heat, cold, dampness; radioactivity, electrical or other disturbances; glare; liquid or solid refuse or wastes; or other substances, condition or element referred to herein as dangerous or objectionable elements in such a manner or in such amount as to adversely affect the surrounding area or adjoining premises; provided, that any use permitted by this chapter may be undertaken and maintained if it conforms to the regulations of this section limiting dangerous and objectionable elements.</p>

		  <p class="P1"><span class="bold">B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="boldunderline">Performance Standards Procedure</span>.</p>

		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Performance standards may be imposed on a proposed use otherwise allowed by right within the zoning district if the Zoning Administrator determines that the proposed use is likely to create or emit dangerous or objectionable elements. The Zoning Administrator’s determination may be appealed to the Planning Commission.</p>

		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If the Zoning Administrator determines that the proposed use may cause the emission of dangerous or objectionable elements, the Zoning Administrator may refer the applicant to one or more expert consultants qualified to advise as to whether a proposed use would adversely affect surrounding areas or adjoining premises by the creation or emission of dangerous or objectionable elements for investigation and report. Such report shall set forth definite findings as to the actual performance of the proposed use, and in a positive and concise manner, recommend such additional installations or safeguards, or devise such standards to be applied as would obviate the creation or emission of dangerous or objectionable elements. Such consultant or consultants shall address his report to the Zoning Administrator and a copy to the applicant at the same time.</p>

		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Whenever the performance standards procedure has been invoked, the applicant shall submit, in addition to the application for a building permit, a plan in duplicate and supplemental statement of the proposed machinery, processes and products, and specifications or standards for the mechanisms and techniques to be used in obviating the emission of dangerous and objectionable elements as set forth in this section. Building permits may be issued only as described in the performance standards approved by the Zoning Administrator for the use.</p>

		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Within 30 days after the Zoning Administrator has received the aforesaid application, or the aforesaid report if a report be required, the Zoning Administrator shall decide whether the proposed use will conform to the requirements of this section, and on such basis shall authorize or refuse to authorize issuance of a zoning-building permit or require a modification of the proposed plan of construction or specifications, proposed equipment or operation. Any zoning-building permit so authorized and issued shall be conditioned upon the applicant’s completed buildings and installations conforming in operation to the performance standards as stipulated in the zoning-building permit. </p>

		  <p class="P1"><span class="bold">C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="boldunderline">Enforcement</span>. Whenever the performance standards procedure has been invoked and a conditioned zoning-building permit has been issued, the Zoning Administrator shall investigate any purported violation of performance standards and, if there is reasonable ground for the same, shall notify the Planning Commission of the occurrence or existence of a probable violation thereof. The Planning Commission shall investigate the alleged violation, and for such investigation may employ qualified experts and hold public hearings. If the Planning Commission finds that a violation has occurred or exists, a copy of such findings shall be forwarded to the Board of Supervisors. The services of any qualified experts employed by the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission to advise in establishing a violation shall be financed by the violator, if such violation is established; otherwise by the County.</p>

		  <p class="P1"><span class="bold">D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="boldunderline">Appeals</span>.

		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Color.</span> Colors on signs and structural members should be harmonious with one another and reflective of the dominant colors of the building or buildings being identified. Contrasting colors may be utilized if the overall effect of the sign is still compatible with the building colors and prevailing colors in the surrounding neighborhood (where a theme can be identified). </p>

		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Materials and structure.</span></p>

		  <p class="P3"><span class="bold">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sign materials (including the materials used in framing and support structures) should be representative of the type and scale of materials used on the building or buildings which the sign identifies.

		  <p class="P3"><span class="bold">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Materials selected for permanent signs shall be durable and capable of withstanding weathering over the life of the sign with reasonable maintenance.</p>

		  <p class="P3"><span class="bold">c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The size of the structural members (e.g. columns, crossbeams, and braces) should be proportional to the sign panel they are supporting. In general, fewer larger supporting members are preferable to many smaller supports.</p>

		  <p class="P3"><span class="bold">d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The use of individual letters incorporated into the building design is encouraged, rather than signs with background and framing other than the building wall.</p>

		  <p class="P3"><span class="bold">e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The use of reflective materials or surfaces should be minimized, and may be approved only where the Zoning Administrator determines that they will not distract motorists or create other hazards.</p>

		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Signs shall not have blinking, flashing, or fluttering lights or other illuminating devices that have a changing light intensity, brightness or color.</p>

		  <p class="P2"><span class="bold">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sign lighting shall be designed and located so that it will not be confused with or construed as traffic control devices, and so that neither the direct nor reflected light from a sign will create a hazard to motorists.</p>
