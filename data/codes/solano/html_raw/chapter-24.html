The director of the department of transportation may grant a reasonable time extension when warranted. In the event the work authorized by the permit is not completed within six months of the date of issuance of the permit, or within the time extension if any granted by the director, the permit shall be void and the permittee shall restore the road to its original condition prior to start of work on the encroachment.</p>

            <p class="P1">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issuance of a permit hereunder shall not be construed as imposing any liability upon the county or upon any of its officers or employees by reason of damage or injury to persons or property resulting from any excavation or obstruction authorized by such permit.</p>

Any omission on the part of the director to specify in the permit what lights, barriers or other protective measures or devices, or the fact that the director may not specify sufficient lights, barriers or other protective measures or devices, shall not excuse the permittee from complying with all requirements of law, and appropriate regulations and ordinances for adequately protecting the safety of those using the county road. If at any time the director finds that suitable safeguards are not being provided after having informed permittee, as well as having specified what corrective measures shall be taken, the county may provide, erect, maintain or relocate such safeguards as are deemed necessary, or may cancel the permit and restore the right-of-way to its former condition, all at the expense of the permittee.</p>

            <p class="P1">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The permittee shall notify the transportation director at the time of beginning work, and at the time of completion of work authorized by the permit.</p>

            <p class="P1">(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All work or use shall be planned and executed in a manner that will cause the least interference with the safe and convenient travel of the general public at the place where the work or use is authorized, and at no time shall a county road be closed or the use thereof denied the general public without the written permission of the director.</p>
