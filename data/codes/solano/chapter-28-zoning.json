It also determines the type of land use approval required for each use, and provides general standards for site development. Agriculture is the major industry in the County generating the majority of the tax revenue in the unincorporated County. Also, agriculture is the largest single zone district classification on the County zoning map. Therefore, the Board of Supervisors has determined that the promotion and preservation of agriculture is of vital interest to the County. The standards stated in this section preserve agriculture a number of ways, including allowing agricultural-related support uses, excluding incompatible uses, and protecting the viability of the family farm. These regulations support the family farm by allowing a secondary dwelling for family members that acts as a form of affordable housing and, for farms with larger acreage, permits a reasonable number of farm labor housing on or near the farming activity.",

It also determines the type of land use approval required for each type of use and provides general standards for site development. Agriculture is the major industry in Solano County, generating the majority of the tax revenue in the unincorporated County. In addition, certain agricultural lands serve an important function in buffering contiguous environmentally sensitive lands of the Suisun Marsh from the effects of urbanization. Therefore, the Board of Supervisors has determined that it is in the interest of the County to prevent further encroachment upon such agricultural lands by incompatible uses of property. The purpose and intent of the A-SM Districts is to preserve lands best suited for permanent agricultural use while limiting certain intensive agricultural practices which may conflict with adjoining sensitive lands. A primary intent of the A-SM Districts is to assure the retention of upland and lowland grasslands adjacent to the Suisun Marsh in uses compatible with its protection.",

Any development within the Suisun Marsh, as defined by Section 29114 of the Public Resources Code, shall be subject to obtaining a Marsh Development Permit pursuant to the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977, and as provided for in Section 28.104. When a land use subject to a Marsh Development Permit is proposed in both the Primary Management Area and Secondary Management Area, as defined in the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977, the land use shall be subject to a Use Permit covering the whole of the project. C. Architectural Review. Architectural Approval may be required for certain uses, in compliance with Section 28.102 (Architectural Approval). D. Building Permits. A Building Permit shall be required prior to any construction. E. Land Use Regulations.

          "text": "A. Purpose. The purpose of design review is to promote a quality rural character in new development for Suisun Valley and to unify the design and construction of individual neighborhood agricultural tourist centers into the existing agriculturally-focused context. B. Design Review Process. Design review is required for any new construction in the A-SV-20, A-T-C and A-T-C-NC Districts and shall follow the process described below: 1. Preliminary Plan Review. Applicants should contact the Resource Management Department to schedule a preliminary application meeting to clarify the County approval process for their particular project and discuss the Design Guidelines as adopted by resolution of the Board of Supervisors. 2. Final Design Review. Based upon the type of permitting required for the project, design review permits will be issued according the provisions of either (a) or (b), as described below: a. Discretionary Permits. When a project requires a discretionary permit, including any rezoning, use permit, sign permit or variance, design review will be approved by the hearing authority as a part of the discretionary permit. The hearing authority shall consider recommendations from staff in its decision. The adopted Design Guidelines and any other established standards shall provide the basis for final approvals. b. Non-discretionary permits. When a project requires a non-discretionary permit, such as an administrative permit or building permit, then the Director of Resource Management, or his or her designee, shall take action administratively on the design review within 10 days of filing of the non-discretionary permit. The Director shall consider recommendations from staff along with the adopted Design Guidelines and any other established standards shall provide the basis for final approvals. C. Design Guidelines. The Suisun Valley design Guidelines (Chapter 4 of the Suisun Valley Strategic Plan) shall serve as the guidelines for the design review of all new construction in the A-SV-20, A-T-C and A-T-C-NC Districts. D. Action by the Hearing Authority. The hearing authority shall take action to approve, conditionally approve or deny the design review within 10 days of the filing of a complete application for design review. If the hearing authority denies a design review permit, then the hearing authority shall provide the applicant with written descriptions of any development proposal design features in a form that constitutes recommended modifications to the project in order to clearly provide the applicant an understanding of the desired changes that would obtain an approval from the hearing authority. E. Findings. The hearing authority shall make the following findings prior to taking action to approve, or conditionally approve design review. The hearing authority finds that: 1. the project conforms to the Suisun Valley Design Guidelines, 2. the project will maintain and enhance the Valley’s agricultural character. 3. the project will maintain, enhance, or restore natural features. 4. the project will preserve the indigenous landscape and rural character. 5. the project will enhance quality of life and economic vitality. 6. the project will enhance the community brand and destination marketing the Valley. 7. the project will ensure the highest quality new construction. 8. the project will minimize site disturbance. 9. the project will preserve views of natural and cultural features. 10. the project will ensure compatibility of new projects with natural and rural landscapes. F. Approval. Design Review approval shall remain valid for a period of one year after which the approval shall lapse and become null and void. The issuance of a building permit shall constitute an extension of the Design Review approval which shall remain valid during the time period the building permit is considered active. G. Occupancy. No structure which has received Design Review approval shall be occupied or used in any manner or receive a certificate of occupancy until the Resource Management Department has inspected and determined that the structure(s) and site development comply with the Development Review approval. H. Appeals. Appeal from any finding or action by the Director of Resource Management or the Planning Commission, unless otherwise provided for in this Division, shall be made pursuant to Section 28-112. I. Amendments. Amendments or changes to existing plans: It shall be at the discretion of the Director of Resource Management to make a determination whether the proposed change or amendment constitutes a significant change requiring additional Design Review.

It also determines the type of land use approval required for each use within each district, and provides general standards for site development. Rural Residential zoning is applied to areas appropriate for rural, low density, single-family homes, where agriculture is not the sole land use and commercial agricultural production capability is low, where self-sufficiency and privacy are desirable and only minimal essential public services and facilities are available. Homesites are to be self-sufficient, with individual wells and individual septic systems. Water may be supplied by a public water system, operated by a public agency, in areas where water from individual wells may be of marginal quantity or quality. Rural Residential is to be applied in a manner that preserves rural character and scenic qualities and protects sensitive resources including agricultural lands, creeks, native trees, open spaces and views. Rural Residential zoning shall not be applied to agricultural lands, or to areas with a high risk of wild fires, landslides, or flooding. Rural Residential zoning is consistent with and implements the Rural Residential land use designation of the General Plan. The three Rural Residential zoning districts are differentiated primarily by density classifications that correspond to potential agricultural productivity and the types of public services required for each district, as follows: [Table] District | Minimum Parcel Size | Land Features | Services Required R-R 2 1/2 | 2.5 acres | Non-productive | Public water supply and individual private sewage disposal systems R-R 5 | 5 acres | Non-productive | Private water wells and individual private sewage disposal systems R-R 10 | 10 acres | Low capability for agricultural production | Private water wells and individual private sewage disposal systems",

It also determines the type of land use approval required for each use within each district, and provides general standards for site development. Residential-Traditional Community districts recognize current residential and mixed-use communities located outside agricultural or municipal service areas where previous development has occurred at higher densities or intensities than currently allowed under County policy. It is the intent to preserve and enhance the character and quality of these communities and promote future infill residential and mixed use development but not to expand the area of these communities. The R-TC Districts replace the following previous districts: R-TC-1AC replaces RE-1; R-TC-20 replaces RE-1/2 R-TC-15 replaces RE-1/3 R-TC-10 replaces RE-1/4 R-TC-6 replaces R-S-6 R-TC-5 replaces R-S-5 R-TC-D-4 replaces R-D (Starr Subdivision) R-TC-D-6 replaces R-D (Homeacres) R-TC-MF replaces R-M The purpose of the different residential-traditional community zoning districts and the manner in which they are applied are as follows: A. Residential-Traditional Community (R-TC) Districts The R-TC zoning districts are intended for areas that have previously been subdivided for single family residential development and provide the community services appurtenant thereto. The regulations for these districts are designed to stabilize and protect the residential characteristics of the districts, to promote and encourage a suitable environment for family life. Nine R-TC zoning districts are denoted with a suffix to indicate the minimum parcel size (e.g. R-TC-4 requires a minimum parcel size of 4,000 square feet), minimum building setbacks, and other requirements. The R-TC zoning districts are consistent with and implement the Traditional Community - Residential land use designation of the General Plan as follows: [Table] Birds Landing | R-TC-1AC Collinsville Township | R-TC-4 Cordelia area | R-TC-15 Elmira area | R-TC-1AC and R-TC-20 Fairfield Unincorporated area | R-TC-1AC, R-TC-20, R-TC-10 and R-TC-D Green Valley area | R-TC-1AC, R-TC-20, and R-TC-15 Rockville Corners | R-TC-1AC Snug Harbor area | R-TC-10 Vallejo Unincorporated area | R-TC-20, R-TC-10, R-TC-6, R-TC-5, R-TC-D & R-TC-MF Willotta Oaks area | R-TC-15, R-TC-10 B. Residential-Traditional Community Mixed Use (R-TC-MU) Districts The Residential-Traditional Community Mixed Use (R-TC-MU) zoning district is intended for certain medium-density residential and retail commercial and business areas that are appropriate for residential and commercial uses, and that can be served by community services. The regulations for this district are designed to stabilize and protect the essential residential characteristics of the district, to promote and encourage a suitable environment for family life and to provide for the integration of retail shops and businesses into the neighborhood. The R-TC-MU zoning district is consistent with and implements the Traditional Community-Mixed Use land use designation of the General Plan as follows: [Table] Vallejo Unincorporated Area | R-TC-MU Birds Landing Area | R-TC-MU Cordelia area | R-TC-MU Elmira area | R-TC-MU",

In addition to the land use permit required by Tables 28-32A and 28-32B, special requirements may apply to certain uses. B. Marsh Development Permit Requirements Any development within the Suisun Marsh, as defined by Section 29114 of the Public Resources Code, shall be subject to obtaining a marsh development permit, pursuant to the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977 and as provided for in Section 28.104 of this Code. When a land use subject to a marsh development permit is proposed in both the Primary Management Area and Secondary Management Area as defined in the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977, the land use shall be subject to a use permit covering the whole of the project. C. Architectural Review Architectural Approval may be required for certain uses, in compliance with Section 28.102 (Architectural Approval). D. Building Permits A Building permit shall be required prior to any construction. E. Land Use Regulations Where the last column in Table 28.32A or 28.32B (Land Use Regulations) includes a section number, e.g. 28.70.10, the zoning regulations in the referenced section apply to the use. Where the last column includes a chapter number, e.g. Chapter 13.6, the regulations in the referenced Solano County Code apply to the use. Provisions in other sections of this Zoning Ordinance may also apply. F. Non-Conforming Uses. Within the Suisun Marsh, as defined by Section 29101 of the Public Resources Code, uses established prior to 1977 that do not conform to the uses set forth in Table 28.32B shall be considered nonconforming uses under Section 28.114, except that non-substantial changes, alterations, and additions to nonconforming uses may be allowed within the existing established project footprint area subject to a marsh development permit, pursuant to the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977 and as provided for in Section 28.104 of this Code. The overall existing development area may not be expanded under these provisions. Development within the existing development area should minimize additional impervious surfaces. An adequate buffer should be established or maintained between the development areas and any water, wetlands, or other Marsh habitat to protect the habitat from adverse environmental impacts. An erosion, sediment, and runoff control plan shall be prepared in accordance with Section 31.26(b) of the Solano County Grading, Drainage, Land Leveling and Erosion Control Ordinance. When the non-conforming uses is located in both the Primary Management Area and Secondary Management Area, as defined by the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977, non-substantial changes, alterations, and additions to the nonconforming use shall be subject to a use permit covering the whole of the project.

It also determines the type of land use approval required for each use within each district, and provides general standards for site development. The purposes of the different commercial zoning districts are as follows: A. Highway Commercial (C-H) District The C-H Districts are intended for commercial uses to serve the highway traveler. The bulk of highway frontage throughout the County is not appropriate for commercial uses but is reserved for exclusive agricultural uses, and is so zoned. C-H Districts are to be established in areas of four acres or larger, and shall be located only where need is clearly indicated. B. Neighborhood Commercial (C-N) District The C-N District is designed to provide an area for a limited number of small retail and service establishments to provide for businesses serving the daily needs of nearby residential neighborhoods or rural community. The intent of this district is to promote convenience shopping goods and services for nearby residents and not for patrons outside the community to be served. Uses established shall be found compatible and developed with standards that prevent significant adverse impacts on land uses adjoining the C-N Districts. C. Commercial Recreation (C-R) District The C-R zoning district is intended to provide appropriate commercial recreation uses that support recreational activities and resource based recreational uses within the County in a manner compatible with surrounding land uses. The C-R zoning district is consistent with the commercial recreation designations of the General Plan outside the Suisun Marsh Management Area. D. Commercial Recreation- Limited (C-R-L) District The C-R-L zoning district is intended to provide for limited commercial recreational uses adjacent to the Suisun Marsh compatible with its protection. The C-R-L zoning district is consistent with the Commercial Recreation land use designation of the General Plan within the Secondary Management Area of the Suisun Marsh. E. Commercial Service (C-S) District The C-S District is designed to provide an area for commercial services of an extensive or heavy nature in support of industrial, construction, or other business activities. F. Business and Professional Office (C-O) District The C-O District is designated primarily to provide an area for business and professional offices.",

It also determines the type of land use approval required for each use within each district, and provides general standards for site development. The purpose of the different industrial and manufacturing zoning districts and the manner in which they are applied are as follows: A. Manufacturing - Limited (M-L) District The M-L District is designed to provide an environment conducive to the development and protection of modern, large scale administrative facilities, research institutions, warehousing, and specialized or light manufacturing organizations, all of a non-nuisance type, in accordance with the concept of an industrial park. B. Manufacturing - General (M-G) District The purpose of the M-G District is to permit the normal operations of almost all industries, subject only to those regulations needed to control congestion and to protect the surrounding area or adjoining premises. The two size designations are designed to provide a differentiation between an intensive and an extensive type of development. C. Industrial - Water Dependent (I-WD) District Certain waterfront lands within Solano County are of Statewide and regional significance because they are among the few remaining deep-water sites suitable for water-dependent industries. Furthermore, significant agricultural and marsh lands are nearby resources which the County is committed to preserve. For this reason, the I-WD District is established to reserve waterfront lands for large-scale, water-dependent industries to assure the efficient use of waterfront industrial sites, and to ensure that impact upon nearby environmentally sensitive lands are minimized. The provisions of this Section shall be strictly interpreted to assure that only those industries which depend on a waterfront site are to locate within this district. It is expressly understood that prior to consideration of any industrial proposal within the district, the Planning Commission shall determine the industry’s need for a waterfront site and assure its conformance with the provisions of the Solano County General Plan, this Chapter, and where applicable, the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977. Industries seeking to locate in the area designated Water Related Industrial Reserve on the Suisun Marsh Protection Plan Map are to be governed by the definition of water-related industry contained in the San Francisco Bay Plan. Those industries which are not considered to be water dependent may continue to locate within other industrial districts. Some of the land in this district is lowland grassland or seasonal marsh which has existing value as wetland habitat or is suitable for restoration to wetland habitat. These areas have subsided and may be filled, using approved dredged sediments, and restored to tidal, managed, or seasonal wetlands, for the purpose of increasing their natural resource value and restoring some of the formerly natural tidal wetland area. Restored wetlands shall remain as wetlands and not be developed for industrial uses.",

Allowed Uses and Permit Requirements Tables 28-42A and 28-42B identifies the land uses allowed by this Zoning Ordinance in each manufacturing and industrial district and the land use permit required to establish each use. In addition to the land use permit required by Tables 28-42A and 28-42B, special requirements may apply to certain uses. B. Marsh Development Permit Requirements Any development within the Suisun Marsh, as defined by Section 29114 of the Public Resources Code, shall be subject to obtaining a marsh development permit pursuant to the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977 and as provided for in Section 28.104 of this Code. When a land use subject to a marsh development permit is proposed in both the Primary Management Area and Secondary Management Area, as defined in the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977, the land use shall be subject to a use permit covering the whole of the project. C. Architectural Review Architectural Approval may be required for certain uses, in compliance with Section 28.102 (Architectural Approval). D. Building Permits A building permit shall be required prior to any construction. Prior to the issuance of a building permit, the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission may require evidence that adequate controls, measures or devices will be provided to meet performance standards for this zone, as provided in Section 28.95, all to insure and protect the public interest, health, comfort, convenience, safety, and general welfare. E. Land Use Regulations Where the last column in Table 28.42A (Land Use Regulations) includes a section number, e.g. 28.70.10, the zoning regulations in the referenced section apply to the use. Where the last column includes a chapter number, e.g. Chapter 13.6, the regulations in the referenced Solano County Code apply to the use. Provisions in other sections of this Zoning Ordinance may also apply. F. Non-Conforming Uses Within the Suisun Marsh, as defined by Section 29114 of the Public Resources Code, uses established prior to August 4, 1981 that do not conform to the uses set forth in Table 28.41A shall be considered nonconforming uses under Section 28.114, except that non-substantial changes, alterations, and additions to nonconforming uses may be allowed within the existing established project footprint area subject to a marsh development permit, pursuant to the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977 and as provided for in Section 28.104 of this Code. The overall existing development area may not be expanded under these provisions. Development within the existing development area should minimize additional impervious surfaces. An adequate buffer should be established or maintained between the development areas and any water, wetlands, or other Marsh habitat to protect the habitat from adverse environmental impacts. An erosion, sediment, and runoff control plan shall be prepared in accordance with Section 31.26(b) of the Solano County Grading, Drainage, Land Leveling and Erosion Control Ordinance. When the non-conforming uses is located in both the Primary Management Area and Secondary Management Area, as defined by the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977, non-substantial changes, alterations, and additions to the nonconforming use shall be subject to a use permit covering the whole of the project. G. Site Development and Other Standards All uses shall comply with the provisions of Article IV, Section 28-90 Site Development and Other Standards which includes standards for parking, signs and other project elements.

          "text": "A. Purpose: The Board of Supervisors finds that the watershed and conservation district areas of Solano County are very valuable natural resources, and in order to protect these areas from the constant threat of wildfire, subsidence, and landslide leading to the destruction and financial loss to private and public property; and in order to prevent increased threats of these hazards through overdevelopment of these areas; and in order to protect the general welfare of the County as a whole, there is hereby created a zone classification within which the establishment, perpetuation and protection of watershed and conservation district shall be encouraged. The provisions of this Section shall be liberally interpreted insofar as they apply to the protection of watershed and conservation district areas. It is the intention of this Section to deter developer from considering lands in a “W” zone as potential urban subdivision property, as residential uses are not compatible with watershed and conservation district areas by the fact that such areas are characterized by slope instability, fire hazards, and the unavailability of water and public services. Those areas to be designated under this zone are fire hazard areas and are subject to slope instability as determined by the Solano County General Plan, and are characterized by the following conditions: 1. Steep topography (defined as slopes in excess of twenty-five percent grade). 2. Excessive vegetation coverage (defined as fifty percent or more of the area or parcel being covered with chaparral or woodland). 3. Inadequate roads (defined as roads below the County standards as to width, alignment, grade or improvement). 4. Lack of available water (defined as insufficient water to sustain a flow of two hundred gallons a minute for twenty minutes). 5. Land susceptible to subsidence or landsliding (defined as characterized by slopes greater than fifteen percent underlain by landslide-prone deposits, or by existing landslide deposits). A range of agricultural uses are found to be compatible with watershed management. However, these uses are specifically defined and prescribed to prevent an increase in the fire or landslide hazards that now exit, and such uses would not require additional public services. These agricultural uses should not attract increased habitation or encourage activities that are not compatible with watershed management. B. W District Land Uses and Permit Requirements. Table 28-51A identifies the land uses allowed by this Zoning Ordinance in the W District and the land use permit required to establish each use. In addition to the land use permit required by Table 28-51A, special requirements may apply to certain uses. Architectural Approval may also be required for certain uses in compliance with Section 28.102 (Architectural Approval). A building permit shall also be required prior to any construction, alteration, remodeling or change in occupancy from a previous building permit. Note: Where the last column in Table 28-51A (“Land Use Regulations”) includes a section number, e.g. 28.74, the zoning regulations in the referenced section apply to the use. Where the last column includes a chapter number, e.g. Chapter 13.6, the regulations in the referenced Solano County Code apply to the use. Provisions in other sections of this Zoning Ordinance may also apply. ## TABLE 28.51A **Legend:** A = Allowed by right, AP = Administrative Permit, MUP = Minor Use Permit, UP = Use Permit, E = Exempt, --- = Prohibited, - = Prohibited | Use | | Regulations | |-----||-------------| | **A.

Marshes, wetlands, and certain adjacent grasslands within the County represent an area of significant aquatic and wildlife habitat and are an irreplaceable and unique resource to the people of the County, State, and the Nation. Therefore, the Board of Supervisors has determined it is in the interest of the County to preserve and enhance the quality and diversity of marsh habitats, within which marsh-oriented uses shall be encouraged to the exclusion of such other uses of land as may be in conflict with the long-term preservation and protection of marsh areas.

The Travis Reserve Area Zoning Overlay implements the Travis Reserve Area, as described and shown in the General Plan, and protects land within the overlay for continued crop production and grazing uses as well as compatible nonavian habitat uses until a military use or other use clearly supporting the mission of the base is proposed for the land. By protecting existing land uses while restricting new development, the overlay zone provides for the future expansion of Travis Air Force Base and supports facilities for the base. No new residential uses are permitted within the Travis Reserve Area Zoning Overlay, and new development or expansion of existing nonresidential uses is subject to discretionary review and shall not be approved unless found to be consistent with the purpose of the Travis Reserve Area Zoning Overlay. B. Allowed Land Uses and Permit Requirements. Crop production, grazing, and agricultural accessory structures less than 2,500 square feet in gross floor area and less than 25 feet in height are allowed. New residential land uses are not permitted. Legal nonconforming residential land uses are subject to Section 28.114. Conservation or mitigation banks for avian species, or which are likely to attract avian species, are not permitted. All other land uses otherwise allowed within the underlaying zoning district shall require approval of a minor use permit prior to development, enlargement or intensification of use, or changes of use, unless a use permit is required.

          "text": "(a) Purpose. The policy plan overlay district is intended to encourage comprehensive planning on focused, large-scale or mixed land use developments. Policy plan overlay districts can provide zoning flexibility by establishing development standards and land use allocations which may vary with the type, density or intensity of use of the underlying district regulations for specific parcels or areas that will ensure balanced and integrated growth guided by creativity and innovation in architecture, planning and environmental design. These standards and uses should accommodate the special needs of the physical site and the community while being consistent with the Solano County General Plan. Development standards are intended to meet or exceed those of the underlying districts described in the other chapters of the Zoning Ordinance while promoting the public health, safety and general welfare without unduly inhibiting the advantages of modern planning and building techniques. The policy plan overlay district requires a detailed development plan that combines the functions of zoning, master, and precise plans, design review, and capital improvement plans in one coordinated process. (b) Applicability. The policy plan overlay district may be combined with all or part of any General Plan area or zoning district designated for this purpose by the General Plan. Each policy plan overlay district shall be shown on the official Solano County zoning map by adding the symbol “-PP” as a designator to a base district along with a clear delineation of the boundaries of the overlay district and an identifying serial number. The serial number shall refer to the Department of Resource Management’s rezoning petition file for the particular policy plan overlay zone application. (c) Initiation of Zone Change. A petition for a policy plan overlay district may be initiated pursuant to Section 28-111 of this Chapter. Application shall be in the form prescribed by the Director of Resource management. The application shall consist of a written plan and graphics for policy guidance, and a detailed statement of standards and uses to determine consistency with the Solano County General Plan. The application shall, at a minimum, include the items and information described in this Section. 1. Fee or fees as set by the Board of Supervisors pursuant to Section 11-111 of this code. No part of such fee shall be refundable. 2. A complete legal description of the subject property. 3. A narrative description of existing uses of the subject property and adjacent properties. 4. Enumeration of existing and proposed ordinance standards along with a detailed explanation of the differences between them. 5. Findings of fact demonstrating the proposed policy plan overlay district in its entirety is consistent with the Solano County General Plan and findings set forth in subdivision (d) of this Section. 6. A set of standards which will define the purpose, intended uses, development density, dimensional constraints and performance standards for the subject property and, in general, shall take the following form: a. Statement of purpose b. Permitted uses c. Accessory uses d. Conditional uses e. Prohibited uses f. Architectural and sign standards g. Height, building coverage, and yard setbacks h. Landscaping i. Parking and loading requirements j. Additional development standards k. Performance standards (e.g., hazardous materials and waste management) l. Site specific policies to ensure adequate protection of the public health and safety and consistency with the surrounding uses m. Exceptions and general provisions 1. A development plan at a scale no smaller than one inch equals a hundred feet shall depict use areas and proposed circulation based on traffic density information provided in subdivision (c)(6). The development plan shall include a schematic representation of subdivision, grading, landscaping and proposed systems of drainage, water supply, sewage disposal and utility service. 2. Representative design and improvement details shall accompany the development plan and be presented in detail to establish that development and construction will be consistent with the proposed policy plan overlay district. Minimum specific design and improvement details shall include typical building elevations, streetscape, and explanation of all relevant features required pursuant to this subdivision. 3. A development schedule describing the sequence and timing of subdivision and capital improvements, along with estimated capital costs and proposed funding mechanism. 4. Such other information as may be required by the Board of Supervisors, Planning Commission, or Director of Resource Management concerning the proposed development and use of such property, or which the applicant may deem appropriate for a full consideration of the proposal by the Board of Supervisors, Planning Commission, and Director of Resource Management. 5. All information required by this Section shall be stated in a manner to describe the character and style of the proposed development and use in sufficient detail to constitute definite criteria under which subsequent development can be judged for compliance. B. Adoption of Policy Plan Overlay District. Adoption of a policy plan overlay district shall be by action of the Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors, including adoption of an ordinance, pursuant to Section 28-111 of this code. The Board of Supervisors shall not approve a policy plan overlay district unless it makes the following findings: (1) The proposed development is in conformity with the General Plan and any applicable specific plan. (2) The proposed development is designed to produce an environment of stable and desirable character consistent with all applicable goals, objectives, policies, proposals, criteria, standards and procedures of the General Plan, and any applicable specific plan for the area in which the proposed development is a part. (3) The proposed development meets applicable development requirements and where possible, exhibits creativity and innovation in architectural, engineering, planning, and environmental design. (4) Adequate mitigation is provided for any use, process, equipment, or materials which are found to be objectionable or to be injurious to property located in the vicinity by reason of odor, fumes, dust, smoke, cinders, glare, unsightliness, hazardous materials, traffic congestion, or to involve any hazard of fire or explosion. Upon approval of the policy plan overlay district by the Planning Commission and adoption by the Board of Supervisors of an ordinance amending the underlying zoning district, no further review by the Board of Supervisors or Planning Commission shall be required under this Chapter except pursuant to Section 28-112 of this Chapter. (e) Interim Applicable Zoning. During review of an application for a policy plan overlay district, no uses of the property subject to such application shall be allowed except those which would have been permitted under the zoning that existed at the time of the policy plan overlay district application. (f) Administration and Modification. The Director of Resource Management is authorized to issue approvals for building construction, site development plans, and for all minor design, site, sign, and building alterations that are deemed substantially in accord with the approved policy plan overlay district. All requests for minor alterations shall be submitted to the Director of Resource Management in writing, and shall include an explanation of the circumstances necessitating such alteration and the substantial conformity of the proposed modification with the approved policy plan overlay district. (g) Conflict and severability. All uses and development in the policy plan overlay district shall also be subject to all other provisions of this code, except that where conflict in regulations occurs, the regulations specified in this Chapter shall prevail. All uses and development in the policy plan overlay district shall also be subject to all applicable provisions of State law, including the California Environmental Quality Act. Wherever possible, the requirements of that act shall be integrated into the approval process for a policy plan overlay district to ensure comprehensive and coordinated review in a timely manner.

B. Good architectural character is based upon the suitability of a building for its purposes, upon the appropriate use of sound materials, and upon the principles of harmony and proportion in the elements of the building. C. Good architectural character is not in itself more expensive than poor architectural character, and is not dependent upon the particular style of architecture selected. D. Where buildings are grouped in close proximity, harmony between individual buildings in any group is of equal importance to the architectural character of any individual building. Similarity of materials, of colors, of landscaping, or character of construction, will help to minimize disharmony between buildings in proximity. E. The aesthetic quality of building design, as evidenced by the use and relationship of materials, color and texture, application of the principles of scale, proportion and harmony, and suitability of structure to its site, shall be comparable to that exhibited in the surrounding area.

For the purpose of assuring the proper right-of-way width of certain streets or highways designated by the General Plan to be of major importance, building lines measured from the centerline of such streets or highways may be established on the zoning maps of this Chapter such building lines, when established, shall supersede the front yard requirements of this Chapter. B. Effect of establishment of building lines. In no case shall any building be hereafter erected, nor shall any use of land be conducted, except the use of land for agriculture, so that such use will be closer to the right-of-way line or any building line which is established for such street or road by this Chapter or any provision of this code or any ordinance of the County. C. Building site special provisions. 1. The use of land as permitted for the district in which it is located shall be permitted on a building site of less area or frontage than that required by the regulations for such district; provided, that such is shown as a lot on a subdivision map of record, or is a parcel of land which was under one ownership on January 29, 1959; provided, that in either case the owner of such lot shall not have owned or purchased any adjoining property since January 29, 1959. For the purpose of this Section, adjoining property shall be deemed to include any parcels which are physically separated by roads, streets, utility easements and railroad right-of-way. 2. A building site shall have its principal frontage on a public or private street; however, for a private street serving more than three building sites, the right-of-way width opening from the public street and along the full length of the private street shall be at least fifty feet. 3. In any A or R-R District the area bounded by the centerline of the public or private road right-of-way on which the parcel fronts, and the parcel sidelines extended to such right-of-way centerline may be included in the computation of the minimum parcel area requirement. 4. A legally established conforming use may be enlarged, provided the added portions conform to yard, building, location and height requirements, and such additions do not encroach upon any required parking space. 5. In any district where one-family dwellings are an allowed use, the Zoning Administrator may authorize an owner to replace an existing dwelling on a developed parcel with a new one-family dwelling and permit occupancy of the existing dwelling for the term of construction of the replacement dwelling or authorize a temporary deferral to complete a zoning requirement to issue a building permit or Certificate of Occupancy; provided that: a. The replacement dwelling shall comply in all respects with yard, building, location, height and parking space requirements of this Chapter. b. The owner executes a written agreement with the County guaranteeing the demolition and removal of the existing dwelling or timely completion of a specified zoning requirement. The owner shall, upon execution of the agreement, deliver to the County a Certificate of Deposit, faithful performance bond with an insurance company authorized to do business in the State, or make a cash deposit with the Treasurer of the County in the amount of money provided for in the agreement. The certificate, bond or cash deposit shall be in such amount as will be sufficient to accomplish such demolition and removal by the owner upon completion of the replacement dwelling or by the County or comply with the zoning requirement in case the agreement is breached by the owner. The decision of the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission as to the amount of deposit required shall be final. The owner shall, in the agreement, consent to agents and employees of the County entering upon his land and demolishing and removing existing dwelling if owner fails to remove such dwelling or verify compliance with the zoning requirement as stipulated in the agreement. 6. The minimum parcel area requirement of the zoning district wherein certain uses may be permitted, subject to the securing of a use permit in each case, may be reduced, provided such use is determined to be any of the following: a. Public service facility; b. Crematory, mausoleum or columbarium; c. Oil and gas wells; d. Radio or television transmission facilities; e. Airport or heliport; f. Any use employing a portion of one or more contiguous lots or parcels, whereby such property is under single or unified control as one ownership, when such ownership meets the minimum area requirement of the district.

No land or building in any district shall be used or occupied in any manner so as to create any dangerous, injurious, noxious or otherwise objectionable fire, explosive or other hazard; noise or vibration; smoke, dust, odor, or other form of air pollution; heat, cold, dampness; radioactivity, electrical or other disturbances; glare; liquid or solid refuse or wastes; or other substances, condition or element referred to herein as dangerous or objectionable elements in such a manner or in such amount as to adversely affect the surrounding area or adjoining premises; provided, that any use permitted by this chapter may be undertaken and maintained if it conforms to the regulations of this section limiting dangerous and objectionable elements. B. Performance Standards Procedure. 1. Performance standards may be imposed on a proposed use otherwise allowed by right within the zoning district if the Zoning Administrator determines that the proposed use is likely to create or emit dangerous or objectionable elements. The Zoning Administrator’s determination may be appealed to the Planning Commission. 2. If the Zoning Administrator determines that the proposed use may cause the emission of dangerous or objectionable elements, the Zoning Administrator may refer the applicant to one or more expert consultants qualified to advise as to whether a proposed use would adversely affect surrounding areas or adjoining premises by the creation or emission of dangerous or objectionable elements for investigation and report. Such report shall set forth definite findings as to the actual performance of the proposed use, and in a positive and concise manner, recommend such additional installations or safeguards, or devise such standards to be applied as would obviate the creation or emission of dangerous or objectionable elements. Such consultant or consultants shall address his report to the Zoning Administrator and a copy to the applicant at the same time. 3. Whenever the performance standards procedure has been invoked, the applicant shall submit, in addition to the application for a building permit, a plan in duplicate and supplemental statement of the proposed machinery, processes and products, and specifications or standards for the mechanisms and techniques to be used in obviating the emission of dangerous and objectionable elements as set forth in this section. Building permits may be issued only as described in the performance standards approved by the Zoning Administrator for the use. 4. Within 30 days after the Zoning Administrator has received the aforesaid application, or the aforesaid report if a report be required, the Zoning Administrator shall decide whether the proposed use will conform to the requirements of this section, and on such basis shall authorize or refuse to authorize issuance of a zoning-building permit or require a modification of the proposed plan of construction or specifications, proposed equipment or operation. Any zoning-building permit so authorized and issued shall be conditioned upon the applicant’s completed buildings and installations conforming in operation to the performance standards as stipulated in the zoning-building permit. C. Enforcement. Whenever the performance standards procedure has been invoked and a conditioned zoning-building permit has been issued, the Zoning Administrator shall investigate any purported violation of performance standards and, if there is reasonable ground for the same, shall notify the Planning Commission of the occurrence or existence of a probable violation thereof. The Planning Commission shall investigate the alleged violation, and for such investigation may employ qualified experts and hold public hearings. If the Planning Commission finds that a violation has occurred or exists, a copy of such findings shall be forwarded to the Board of Supervisors. The services of any qualified experts employed by the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission to advise in establishing a violation shall be financed by the violator, if such violation is established; otherwise by the County. D. Appeals. Appeal from the action of the Zoning Administrator may be made according to the provisions of Section 28.112. (Ord. No. 1840, §37)",

A Master Sign Plan is required prior to the issuance of any sign permit for: 1. A new nonresidential project with four or more tenants; or 2. Exterior remodeling of an existing nonresidential project with four or more tenants that involves major rehabilitation work or a request to modify 50 percent or more of the existing signs on the site within a 12-month period.

All signs installed or replaced within the nonresidential project pursuant to a Master Sign Plan shall comply with the approved Master Sign Plan. B. Content of plan. A Master Sign Plan shall provide standards for the uniform style, construction, size, and placement of signs within the proposed nonresidential project. C. Additional signage. The Zoning Administrator, in approving a Master Sign Plan, may permit an increase in the number of signs and the total allowable sign area when, in the judgment of the Zoning Administrator, the total number of tenants or the configuration of the site and buildings warrant an increase in signage and larger signage would not be detrimental to the appearance of the area. The maximum allowable increase is limited to double the allowable maximum number of signs and allowable sign area. D. Findings for approval. A Master Sign Plan shall not be approved unless the Zoning Administrator first makes all the following findings: 1. The proposed signs do not exceed the standards of Sections 28.96.60 (Zoning District Sign Standards) and 28.96.70 (Standards for Specific Types of Signs), and are of the minimum size and height necessary to enable motorists and pedestrians to readily identify the facility or site from a sufficient distance to safely and conveniently access the facility or site; 2.

          "text": "A. Sign area. The measurement of sign area to determine compliance with the sign area limitations of this Section shall occur as follows: 1. The surface area of a sign shall be calculated by enclosing the extreme limits of all framing, writing, logo, representation, emblem, or other display within a single continuous perimeter composed of squares or rectangles with no more than eight lines. See Figure A. Figure A SIGN AREA MEASUREMENT 2. Supporting framework or bracing that is clearly incidental to the display itself shall not be computed as sign area. 3. The area of a double-faced (back-to-back) sign shall be calculated as a single sign face if the distance between each sign face does not exceed 18 inches, and the two faces are parallel with each other. 4. Where a sign consists of one or more three-dimensional objects (e.g., balls, cubes, clusters of objects, sculpture or statue-like trademarks), the sign area shall be measured as their maximum projection upon a vertical plane. See Figure B. 5. For signs that incorporate time and temperature devices, the area of these devices shall not be included in the total area of the sign. B. Sign height (freestanding). The height of a freestanding sign shall be measured as the vertical distance from the finished grade adjacent to the base of the sign structure to the highest point of the structure, where finished grade does not include fill, planters, or other material artificially placed to increase sign height. C. Sign location requirements. 1. All signs shall be located on the same site as the subject of the sign, except as otherwise allowed by this Section. A sign may project over an adjacent public right-of-way only when authorized by an encroachment permit as well as a sign permit. 2. No sign shall be located within, or so that it overhangs a public right-of-way, except as otherwise allowed by this Section. 3. The location of each sign shall be evaluated during the sign permit process to ensure that: a. The proposed setback is appropriate for the height and area of a freestanding or projecting sign; b. A wall-mounted flush or projecting sign is consistent with the architectural design of the building, and does not cover windows or architectural features other than undecorated wall surfaces; c. A sign does not unreasonably block sight lines to an existing sign on adjacent property; and d. The sign does not impair pedestrian or vehicular safety. D. Design criteria for signs. The following design criteria shall be used in reviewing the design of individual signs. Substantial conformance with each of the following design criteria shall be required before a sign permit or building permit can be approved. 1. Color. Colors on signs and structural members should be harmonious with one another and reflective of the dominant colors of the building or buildings being identified. Contrasting colors may be utilized if the overall effect of the sign is still compatible with the building colors and prevailing colors in the surrounding neighborhood (where a theme can be identified). 2. Materials and structure. a. Sign materials (including the materials used in framing and support structures) should be representative of the type and scale of materials used on the building or buildings which the sign identifies. Insofar as possible, sign materials should match the materials used on the building and on other signs. b. Materials selected for permanent signs shall be durable and capable of withstanding weathering over the life of the sign with reasonable maintenance. c. The size of the structural members (e.g. columns, crossbeams, and braces) should be proportional to the sign panel they are supporting. In general, fewer larger supporting members are preferable to many smaller supports. d. The use of individual letters incorporated into the building design is encouraged, rather than signs with background and framing other than the building wall. e. The use of reflective materials or surfaces should be minimized, and may be approved only where the Zoning Administrator determines that they will not distract motorists or create other hazards. E. Illumination of signs. When allowed by Section 28.96.60 (Zoning District Sign Standards), the artificial illumination of signs, either from an internal or external source, shall be designed to minimize light and glare on surrounding rights-of-way and properties. 1. External light sources shall be directed and shielded to limit direct illumination of any object other than the sign. 2. The light from an illuminated sign shall not be of an intensity or brightness that will interfere with the reasonable enjoyment of residential properties. In areas with low ambient nighttime illumination levels (e.g., residential neighborhoods or business districts with little or no illuminated signing) applicants shall be encouraged to use light, illuminated copy against dark or opaque backgrounds. 3. Signs shall not have blinking, flashing, or fluttering lights or other illuminating devices that have a changing light intensity, brightness or color. 4. Sign lighting shall be designed and located so that it will not be confused with or construed as traffic control devices, and so that neither the direct nor reflected light from a sign will create a hazard to motorists. 5. The direct lighting of signs shall be prohibited. For the purposes of this Section, “direct lighting” means the use of reflective-type bulbs or incandescent lamps on the exterior surface of a sign to form the text or images of sign copy. 6. Light sources shall utilize energy efficient fixtures to the greatest extent possible. 7. Illuminated panels, visible tubing, and strings of lights outlining all or a portion of a building, other than lighting that is primarily for indirectly illuminating architectural features, signs, or landscaping, shall be deemed “signs” subject to this Section and shall be counted as part of the allowed sign area. Each line of tubing or lights shall be deemed to have a minimum width of at least six inches for the purpose of area calculation. F. Maintenance of signs. Signs and supporting hardware, including temporary signs, shall be maintained in good repair at all times. Repairs to signs shall be of equal or better in quality of materials and design as the original sign. Signs that are not properly maintained and are dilapidated shall be deemed a public nuisance, and may be abated. G. Removal of signs. When existing signs are removed or replaced, all brackets, poles, and other supports that are no longer required shall also be removed. Unpainted areas shall be painted to match the adjacent portion of the building or sign support structure. (Ord. No. 1840, §41)",

Unless the marsh development permit application is withdrawn, action to approve, conditionally approve, or deny the marsh development permit shall be taken by the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission within the time limits specified in the Permit Streamlining Act, except that the applicant and Zoning Administrator may mutually agree to extend such period. 4. Any action taken by the Zoning Administrator or the Planning Commission on a marsh development permit application shall not become effective until: (i) The time period for filing an appeal pursuant to Section 28.112 of this Chapter has expired or, if an appeal has been filed, the appeal has been finally decided or withdrawn; and (ii) The twenty (20) working day period after the Bay Conservation and Development Commission has received notice of the County’s final action approving the marsh development permit has expired or, if an appeal by or to the Bay Conservation and Development Commission has been filed, the appeal has been withdrawn or the Bay Conservation and Development Commission either determines that the appeal raises no substantial issue or takes no action on the appeal within the time limits specified in section 29524 of the Public Resources Code. H. Required Findings A marsh development permit shall not be approved unless the all of the following general findings are made: 1. That the application process complies with the California Environmental Quality Act of 1970, as amended. 2.

That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, and other necessary facilities have been or are being provided. 4. That the applicant has exhibited proof that such use will not constitute a nuisance or be detrimental to the health, safety, comfort, or general welfare of the people of the County, or be detrimental to adjacent property or improvements to the neighborhood. 5. That the proposed development shall be consistent with the certified Suisun Marsh Local Protection Program. Where the proposed development is located in both the Secondary and Primary Management Areas, all portions of the proposed development shall be consistent with the certified Suisun Marsh Local Protection Program. I. Revocation 1. In any case where the conditions of a marsh development permit have not been or are not complied with, or where the use has been abandoned, the Zoning Administrator shall give to the permittee notice of intention to revoke such permit, at least fifteen days prior to a Planning Commission review thereof. 2. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply to revocation proceedings, and witnesses need not be sworn, but the permittee shall be given an opportunity to respond to any evidence or testimony presented by the Zoning Administrator or the public. After conclusion of the review, the Planning Commission may revoke such permit or modify the permit by imposing new or modified conditions to address the previous noncompliance. J. Expiration 1. Marsh development permits approved for a temporary, fixed period of time shall expire on the date specified in the permit and shall thereafter be null and void, but any such permit may be revised to modify its expiration date if an application to do so is filed at least 30 days prior to the expiration date.

Renewal A marsh development permit approved for an indefinite period shall be subject to periodic renewal every five years, or such other period of time as may be set by the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission in approving a marsh development permit. The Zoning Administrator shall administratively approve a marsh development renewal if the following conditions are satisfied: 1. The permittee has requested renewal; 2. The permittee has paid a renewal fee as may be set by the Board of Supervisors, pursuant to Section 11-111 of this Code: and 3. The development is in full compliance with all conditions of the marsh development permit.

          "text": "A. Purpose. The purpose of the use permit is to provide for public review of certain land uses that may be compatible with other allowed and permitted land uses within a zoning district, but due to their type or intensity require consideration of location, site design, adjacent land uses, availability of public infrastructure and services, and environmental impacts. A use permit may be approved either for a fixed term or for an indefinite term subject to periodic renewal. Action on a use permit is discretionary. B. Compliance With Building Codes or Other Ordinances. Approval of a use permit does not exempt the applicant from complying with requirements of building codes adopted pursuant to other provisions of this code or other ordinances. C. Application. Applications for use permits shall be made in writing on a form prescribed by the Zoning Administrator, and shall be accompanied by floor plans, site plans, operating plans and data necessary to show that requirements set forth in subsection (H) of this section and in Article III of this chapter are fulfilled. Such application shall not be accepted as complete unless accompanied by a fee or fees as may be set by the Board of Supervisors pursuant to Section 11-111. No part of such fee shall be refundable. Once a complete application is submitted, additional information and processing fees may be required in order to conduct environmental review of the proposal. Either before or after a complete application has been submitted, if additional information or processing fees are required and are requested from the applicant, in writing, but are not provided by the applicant within 60 days of such a request, the Zoning Administrator may determine that the application has been abandoned and shall promptly notify the applicant of such determination. D. Public Hearing. A public hearing on a use permit application shall be held by the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission, who shall maintain a public record of all hearings. Applications for minor use permits, extensions of time to exercise a previously approved use permit, minor revisions to use permits, and amendments to use permits originally approved by the Zoning Administrator shall be heard by the Zoning Administrator, who may administratively refer any such application to the Planning Commission for hearing. All other applications shall be heard by the Planning Commission. However, a use permit being processed concurrently with an application requiring action by the Board of Supervisors shall be scheduled for public hearing before the Planning Commission for its recommendation and then the Board of Supervisors for final action. E. Public Notice. Notice of the hearing shall be given pursuant to Section 28.04. F. Minor Use Permits. Uses which are eligible for a minor use permits are designated in the Table of Allowable Uses contained within each zoning district in Article II of this Chapter. All references to use permits in this Article include minor use permits, unless different rules or procedures are described for minor use permits. G. Action 1. The Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission may approve a use permit for an ownership if it finds that the requirements set forth in this Chapter and in subdivisions (H) of this Section and Article III of this Chapter are fulfilled. 2. When approving a use permit, the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission may impose conditions in addition to the general conditions enumerated in subdivisions (H) of this Section, together with guarantees that such conditions will be complied with, when such additional conditions are in the public interest. 3. If a project is revised during the hearing, then the Zoning Administrator of the Planning Commission may require that a revised development plan be submitted which reflects all of the changes approved at the hearing. 4. Unless the use permit application is withdrawn, action to approve, conditionally approve, or deny the use permit shall be taken by the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission within the time limits specified in the Permit Streamlining Act; except that the applicant and Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission may mutually agree to extend such period. 5. Any action taken by the Zoning Administrator or the Planning Commission on a use permit application shall not become effective until the time for filing an appeal has expired or, if an appeal has been filed, the appeal has been decided or withdrawn. H. Required Findings. A use permit shall not be approved unless the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission first makes all of the following general findings: 1. That the establishment, maintenance or operation of a use or building applied for are in conformity to the General Plan for the County with regard to traffic circulation, population densities, and distribution, and other aspects of the General Plan considered by the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission to be pertinent. 2. That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and other necessary facilities have been or are being provided. 3. That applicant exhibits proof that such use will not, under the circumstances of the particular case, constitute a nuisance or be detrimental to the health, safety, peace, morals, comfort or general welfare of persons residing or working in or passing through the neighborhood of such proposed use, or be detrimental or injurious to property and improvements in the neighborhood or to the general welfare of the County; provided, that if any proposed building or use is necessary for the public health, safety or general welfare, that finding shall be to that effect. I. Revision or amendment. Once a use permit becomes effective, the land use subject to the permit may be developed and operated only in substantial conformance with the terms and conditions of the approved permit. The Director shall have authority to determine whether any proposed development or use on the ownership is in substantial conformance with the terms and conditions of an approved use permit. Any proposed development or operation on the ownership that would not be in substantial conformance with the terms and conditions of the use permit shall not be initiated or undertaken until a revision or amendment to the permit has been approved. When an owner proposes changes to a use permit, the Director shall determine whether the proposed change shall be processed either as a minor revision or an amendment to the use permit. The Director’s determination shall be final and not subject to appeal. 1. Interpretation of conditions. If an owner believes that a condition in an approved use permit is unclear, the Director shall determine the intent of the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission in imposing the condition and provide a written clarification to the permittee. 2. Minor revision. Minor revisions not constituting significant change in the use, not requiring a substantial alteration in the use permit or any element thereof, may be reviewed and approved by the Zoning Administrator. Each application for a minor revision shall be accompanied by a fee as may be set by the Board of Supervisors, pursuant to Section 11-111. No part of said fee or fees shall be refundable. 3. Amendment. Significant changes in the use or the size or intensity of the use, requiring a substantial alteration of the use permit, shall be in the same manner as a new use permit, in compliance with this section. Amendments shall be heard by either the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission, whichever first heard the original use permit. Each application for an amendment shall be accompanied by a fee as may be set by the Board of Supervisors, pursuant to Section 11-111. No part of said fee or fees shall be refundable. 4. The approval of a minor revision or amendment to a use permit shall supersede the previously approved permit. J. Revocation. 1. In any case where the conditions of a use permit have not been or are not substantially complied with, or where the use has been abandoned, the Zoning Administrator may initiate permit revocation proceedings. 2. Notice of intention to revoke the use permit shall be given to the owner at least 15 days prior to the Planning Commission’s revocation hearing. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply to revocation proceedings, and witnesses need not be sworn, but the owner shall be given an opportunity to respond to any evidence or testimony presented by the Zoning Administrator or the public. After conclusion of the review, the Planning Commission may revoke the permit if it finds that the terms and conditions of the use permit have not been substantially complied with, or may modify the permit by imposing new or modified conditions to address the previous noncompliance. Noncompliance with permit conditions shall be presumed to cause harm and a specific finding of harm or damage to neighboring properties or land uses shall not be required to support revocation. K. Expiration. 1. In any case where a use permit has not been exercised within one year after the date of approval thereof, or any other period for exercise as stated in a condition of the permit, the use permit shall expire and thereafter be null and void without further action by the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission; except that, upon written request by the owner, the Zoning Administrator may authorize an extension of time to exercise the permit, not to exceed one year. Only one such extension may be granted. 2. Once exercised, a use permit approved for a temporary, fixed period of time shall expire on the date specified in the permit and shall thereafter be null and void, but any such permit may be revised pursuant to subsection (I)(2) of this section to modify its expiration date if an application to do so is filed at least 30 days prior to the expiration date. 3. A use permit approved for an indefinite period does not expire once exercised, but shall be revoked by the Planning Commission if abandoned or not timely renewed. L. Reapplication. Whenever a use permit application has been denied for a specific use, no new application covering all or a portion of the property involved in the original application, shall be accepted by the Department of Resource Management for a period of six months from the effective date of the final denial of the original application; provided that, upon a showing of a substantial change of circumstances, the Director may permit the filing of such new application prior to the expiration of such six-month period. M. Appeal. Appeal from the action of the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission may be made according to the provisions of Section 28.112. N. Renewal. A use permit approved for an indefinite term shall be subject to periodic renewal every five years or such other period of time established in this chapter or as may be set by the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission in approving the use permit. The Zoning Administrator shall administratively approve a use permit renewal, without public notice or hearing, if all of the following criteria are met: 1. The owner has requested renewal; 2. The owner has paid a renewal fee as may be set by the Board of Supervisors pursuant to Section 11-111; and 3. The use is being conducted in full compliance with all conditions of the use permit. The Zoning Administrator’s determination that all criteria are met and decision to approve renewal of the use permit are nonappealable. If the Zoning Administrator is unable to approve a renewal, the use permit shall be set for revocation. Every use permit approved prior to October 28, 2010, and still in effect as of that date shall be subject to the renewal period and procedure described in this subsection unless a different renewal period or procedure is specifically described in the conditions of the permit or this chapter.

B. Conditions. Variances from the terms of this Chapter may be granted only when the following conditions are found: 1. Because of special circumstances applicable to subject property, including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, the strict application of this Chapter is found to deprive subject property of privileges enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity and under identical zone classifications. 2. Variance granted shall not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and zoning district in which subject property is situated. C. Application. Applications for variances shall be filed by the owner or the owner’s agent with the Department upon such forms and accompanied by such plans and data as may be prescribed by the Zoning Administrator so as to assure the fullest practical presentation of facts for the permanent record.

The waiver request shall be submitted on an application form prepared by the Department of Resource Management and is subject to the noticing requirements as set forth in Section 28.04(F). The Zoning Administrator’s decision to approve a waiver is nonappealable but a decision to deny a waiver may be appealed by the applicant in accordance with Section 28.112. B. Reasonable Accommodation Waiver. A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any person with a disability or their representative to modify applicable zoning development standards that may act as a barrier to equal opportunity to specific housing of their choice, without the need for the approval of a variance. A request for reasonable accommodation may include a modification or exception to the rules, standards, and practices for the siting, development, and use of housing or housing-related facilities. The grant of a reasonable accommodation request to a person with a disability is a personal privilege that does not apply to the successors in interest to the property. The waiver request shall be submitted on an application form prepared by the Director of Resource Management and is subject to the noticing requirements as set forth in Section 28.04(F). The Director of Resource Management, as the granting authority, shall review the application and grant or deny the waiver based on consideration of the following factors: 1. Whether the specific housing, which is the subject of the request, will be used by an individual with a disability protected under fair housing laws. 2. Whether the requested accommodation is necessary to make specific housing available to an individual with a disability protected under fair housing laws. 3. Whether there are alternative reasonable accommodations that may provide an equivalent level of benefit. 4. Whether the requested accommodation would impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the County. 5. Whether the requested accommodation would require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the County’s land use and zoning program. 6. Whether the requested accommodation would reduce barriers and increase visitability on the site, in light of physical attributes of the property and its structures. (Ord. No. 1757, §7; Ord.

A. Initiation. An amendment may be initiated by: 1. One or more owners of property to be affected by the proposed amendment, upon a verified petition filed with the Department of Resource Management, accompanied by a fee or fees as may be set by the Board of Supervisors by resolution pursuant to Section 11-111 of this Code. No part of such fee shall be refundable. 2. By the Director of Resource Management as the Director deems necessary, or at the direction of the Planning Commission or the Board of Supervisors. B. Public Hearings. 1. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on any proposed amendment that changes any property from one zone to another or imposes, modifies, or removes any regulation which affects the permitted uses of real property, including land, buildings, signs and other structures. 2. Notice of the hearing shall be given pursuant to Section 28.04. After conclusion of its hearing, the Planning Commission shall render its decision by recommending approval, approval with modifications, or disapproval of the proposed amendment. The recommendation shall include the reasons for the recommendation, and shall describe the relationship of the proposed amendment to the General Plan and any applicable specific plan. The Planning Commission shall file with the Board of Supervisors an attested copy of a report of its recommendations within 90 days after the conclusion of the public hearings. 3. Upon receipt of such report from the Planning Commission the Board of Supervisors shall set the matter for public hearing and shall give notice thereof pursuant to Section 28.04 and to the same persons and organizations who were given notice of the Planning Commission hearing. After conclusion of its hearing, the Board of Supervisors may enact the proposed amendment or any part thereof in such form as the Board may deem advisable to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare of the County, or it may deny the proposed amendment. Prior to enacting any alternative to the proposed amendment that was not previously considered by the Planning Commission during its hearing, the Board shall first refer the alternative to the Planning Commission for report and recommendation. The Planning Commission is not required to hold a public hearing or issue a report and recommendation on the alternative. Failure of the Planning Commission to issue a report and recommendation within 60 days after the Board makes its referral shall be deemed to be a positive recommendation on the alternative. However, if the proposal requests only that property be rezoned from one zoning district to another and the Planning Commission has recommended disapproval of the proposal, then the Board of Supervisors is not required to take any further action on the proposal unless an interested person requests a hearing by filing a written request with the Clerk of the Board within 10 days after the Planning Commission files its recommendation with the Board. If no request for hearing is timely filed or if the Board does not initiate review as described in Section 28.112(F), then the proposal shall be deemed denied 10 days after the Planning Commission files its recommendation with the Board. 4. Upon the consent of the Planning Commission, any petition for an amendment may be withdrawn upon the written request of a majority of all persons who signed the petition. The Board of Supervisors or the Planning Commission, as the case may be, may, by resolution, abandon any proceedings for an amendment initiated by its own direction; provided, that such abandonment may be made only when such proceedings are before such body for consideration; and provided further, that any hearing of which public notice has been given shall be held. 5. Whenever a petition for an amendment to this chapter has been denied, no new petition for the same amendment shall be accepted by the Department for a period of one year from the effective date of the final denial of the original petition; provided, that upon a showing of a substantial change of circumstances, the Director of Resource Management may permit the filing of such new petition prior to the expiration of such one-year period. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Supervisors or Planning Commission from at any time initiating any proceedings which either of such bodies may initiate pursuant to this section.

Any use of buildings or land in violation of this chapter, including any use of buildings or land which has not been authorized in the manner required by this chapter, is prohibited and is declared to be a public nuisance. B. Any violation of the terms or conditions of any permit or entitlement issued by the Zoning Administrator, Planning Commission, or Board of Supervisors pursuant to this chapter shall constitute a violation of this chapter. C. All departments, officials and public employees of the County which are vested with the duty or authority to issue permits or licenses shall conform to the provisions of this chapter, and shall issue no such permits or licenses for uses, buildings, or purposes where the same would be in conflict with the provisions of this chapter; and any such permits or licenses, if issued in conflict with the provisions of this chapter, shall be null and void. D. The County may refuse to issue any discretionary or ministerial permit, license, variance or other entitlement, which is sought pursuant to this chapter, including zoning clearance for a building permit, where the property upon which the use or structure is proposed is in violation of this chapter. E. The Zoning Administrator shall issue a notice of violation to any person who has erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, converted, altered, or added to any building or structure in violation of this chapter, or who is using or allowing the use of that person’s property in violation of this chapter, when such enforcement would protect the public health, safety, or general welfare. The notice of violation shall specify the nature of the alleged violation, what corrective action is required, and when the corrective action shall be completed. The Zoning Administrator may, but is not required to, attempt to resolve the matter informally or provide a written warning of violation prior to issuing a notice of violation. F. The notice of violation, including the allegations concerning nature of the violation, the required corrective action, and the deadline for corrective action, may be appealed in accordance with Section 28.112. If the notice of violation is not timely appealed, the allegations in the notice are deemed admitted and the specified corrective action, including the time for completion, are deemed accepted as reasonable and appropriate. The allegations in the notice of violation, either as originally issued and not timely appealed or as upheld or modified on appeal, shall constitute the County’s final determination that the buildings or use of property is in violation of this chapter.

          "title": "Nonconforming Uses",
          "text": "A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish uniform provisions for the regulation of nonconforming structures, and uses of land that were legally established before the amendment, of this Chapter, or previously adopted County ordinances, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted differently under the current provisions of this Chapter or future amendments. B. Intent. It is the intent of this Chapter to: 1. Discourage the long-term continuance of these nonconformities, providing for their eventual elimination, but to permit them to exist under the limited conditions outlined in this section. 2. Prevent nonconforming uses and structures from being enlarged, expanded, or extended, or being used as justification for adding other structures or uses that are prohibited by the provisions of this Chapter applicable to the zoning district in which the nonconformity is located. C. Continuance of Existing Nonconforming Uses. An ongoing use of land or buildings lawfully established and existing prior to the adoption of any provision of this Chapter that renders such use nonconforming with the regulations currently specified by this Chapter for the district in which such land is located, may be continued; provided, that no such use shall be enlarged or increased, nor be extended to occupy a greater area than that occupied by such use at the time such use was rendered nonconforming; and provided further, that if such use ceases as hereinafter provided, the subsequent use of such land shall be in conformity to the regulations specified by this Chapter for the district in which such land is located. 1. Repairs and Maintenance. Except as may be provided in 28.114(H) below, ordinary maintenance and repairs may be made to any nonconforming structure or building; provided that, no structural alterations are made except those required by law or ordinance; and provided further, such work does not exceed twenty-five percent of the actual value of the structure or building in any one-year period. 2. Destruction and Reconstruction. Except as may be provided in 28.114H below, if at any time a building in existence prior to an amendment to this Chapter which does not conform to the regulations, including parking regulations for the district in which it is located, is damaged or destroyed by fire or other natural hazard, explosion, act of God, or act of the public enemy, to the extent of more than sixty percent of the actual value of the structure or building according to the assessment by the County assessor for the fiscal year during which such destruction occurs, the land and building shall be subject to all the regulations specified by this Chapter for the district in which such land and building are located. 3. Expansion. Except as provided in 28.114(H) below, a non-conforming use of the land or structure shall not be permitted to expand. 4. Structural Alterations. Except as provided in 28.114(H) below, a non-conforming use of the land or structure shall not be permitted to make structural alterations. D. Nonconforming Lots. Nonconforming lots are lots legally established prior to the adoption of this Chapter or any subsequent amendments, which do not meet one or more development standards for lot area, lot frontage or lot access. Notwithstanding such nonconformities, development may be approved pursuant to this Chapter if the Director of Resource Management determines that such development is in compliance with all other provisions of this Chapter. E. Use Permits. Any use for which a use permit is required and may be granted by the terms of this Chapter shall be considered a nonconforming use unless and until a use permit is obtained in accordance with Section 28-106. The approval of a use permit shall supersede and extinguish any grandfathered rights to continue the nonconforming use. F. Termination. If the actual operation of a nonconforming use of a building ceases for a continuous period of six months, unless the legal owner can establish valid proof to the contrary, such cessation of the nonconforming use shall be considered abandonment. Without further action by the Planning Commission, the building and the land on which the building is located, shall be subject to all the regulations specified by this Chapter for the district in which such land and building are located. G. Zoning Clearance. Prior to the issuance of a building permit, business license, grading permit, well or septic permit for a nonconforming use, a zoning clearance must be issued by the Director of Resource Management that sets forth the extent of nonconformity and the permissible repair, maintenance, or alteration that may be made to the structures, buildings, and ownership. H. Exceptions. 1. Prior Commencement of Construction. Nothing contained in this Chapter shall be deemed to require any change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building for which a building or other construction permit was issued and upon which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the adoption of any amendment to this Chapter. Actual construction is hereby defined to be the actual placing of construction materials in their permanent position, fastened in a permanent manner; actual work in excavating a basement; or the demolition or removal of any existing structure begun preparatory to rebuilding; provided, that in all cases, actual construction work shall be diligently carried on until the completion of the building or structure involved. 2. Companion Living Units. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10 of this Chapter, where Companion Living Unit and Secondary Living Unit are defined, certain unpermitted, non-conforming dwelling units may be brought into compliance with the Solano County Code and the California Building Code. The provisions set forth in this subdivision shall only be applicable through December 31, 1996, after which all provisions of this Code shall apply.

The unit shall have existed as a substantially improved dwelling prior to December 8, 1994; and b. In the case of Companion Living Unit, as defined, the improved livable space may be no larger than 850 square feet, either as it existed or as it shall be altered, so as to not exceed the maximum square footage allowable under the Solano County.

The 850 sq. ft. maximum livable space shall not be retroactively applied to Secondary Living Units, as defined, seeking permitted status under this section; and c. All necessary building permits shall be applied for and obtained and as-built construction approved by the Building Official as conforming with the applicable zoning and building codes; and d. The property owner shall certify that the Companion Living Unit shall be solely used for the purposes of providing independent living quarters for one or more adult persons who are sixty years of age or over, handicapped or convalescent. Either the principal residence or companion living unit shall be owner occupied. 3. Dwellings. Nonconforming primary and secondary dwellings, and duplexes, which were lawfully established, may continue subject to the following restrictions: a. Repairs and Maintenance. Ordinary maintenance and repairs may be made to any nonconforming primary or secondary dwelling or duplex, provided that, no expansion or structural alterations are made except those required by law or ordinance, or as provided for below. b. Destruction and Reconstruction. If at any time a primary or secondary dwelling or duplex in existence prior to the adoption of any amendment to this Chapter. which does not conform to the regulations, including parking regulations for the district in which it is located, is damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion, act of God, or act of the public enemy, a new primary or secondary dwelling or duplex may be constructed in the same location, provided it does not expand the area of the previous footprint by more than 25 percent. The new dwelling will remain legal nonconforming. c. Expansion. The square footage area of a primary or secondary dwelling or duplex may be expanded by up to 25 percent, or to the maximum size permitted under current regulations, whichever is less. d. Structural Alterations. Structural alterations are permitted for a nonconforming primary or secondary dwelling or duplex. e. Zoning Clearance Required. Prior to the issuance of a building permit, grading permit, septic or well permit for a nonconforming primary or secondary dwelling or duplex, a zoning clearance must be issued by the Director of Resource Management which sets forth the extent of nonconformity and the permissible repair, maintenance, alteration or expansion of the dwelling. 4. Nonconforming churches in the A-SV-20 or ATC District, legally established prior to February 21, 2019, and subject to an approved use permit, may be enlarged or expanded; provided, that any such enlargement or expansion complies with the development standards in Section 28.73.30(B)(1), is contained entirely within the parcel originally approved for the use, would not adversely impact agricultural operations on nearby properties, and is approved as an amendment to the use permit.
