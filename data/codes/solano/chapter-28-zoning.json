The Travis Reserve Area Zoning Overlay implements the Travis Reserve Area, as described and shown in the General Plan, and protects land within the overlay for continued crop production and grazing uses as well as compatible nonavian habitat uses until a military use or other use clearly supporting the mission of the base is proposed for the land. By protecting existing land uses while restricting new development, the overlay zone provides for the future expansion of Travis Air Force Base and supports facilities for the base. No new residential uses are permitted within the Travis Reserve Area Zoning Overlay, and new development or expansion of existing nonresidential uses is subject to discretionary review and shall not be approved unless found to be consistent with the purpose of the Travis Reserve Area Zoning Overlay. B. Allowed Land Uses and Permit Requirements. Crop production, grazing, and agricultural accessory structures less than 2,500 square feet in gross floor area and less than 25 feet in height are allowed. New residential land uses are not permitted. Legal nonconforming residential land uses are subject to Section 28.114. Conservation or mitigation banks for avian species, or which are likely to attract avian species, are not permitted. All other land uses otherwise allowed within the underlaying zoning district shall require approval of a minor use permit prior to development, enlargement or intensification of use, or changes of use, unless a use permit is required.

          "title": "POLICY PLAN OVERLAY (PP) DISTRICTS",
          "text": "(a) Purpose. The policy plan overlay district is intended to encourage comprehensive planning on focused, large-scale or mixed land use developments. Policy plan overlay districts can provide zoning flexibility by establishing development standards and land use allocations which may vary with the type, density or intensity of use of the underlying district regulations for specific parcels or areas that will ensure balanced and integrated growth guided by creativity and innovation in architecture, planning and environmental design. These standards and uses should accommodate the special needs of the physical site and the community while being consistent with the Solano County General Plan. Development standards are intended to meet or exceed those of the underlying districts described in the other chapters of the Zoning Ordinance while promoting the public health, safety and general welfare without unduly inhibiting the advantages of modern planning and building techniques. The policy plan overlay district requires a detailed development plan that combines the functions of zoning, master, and precise plans, design review, and capital improvement plans in one coordinated process. (b) Applicability. The policy plan overlay district may be combined with all or part of any General Plan area or zoning district designated for this purpose by the General Plan. Each policy plan overlay district shall be shown on the official Solano County zoning map by adding the symbol “-PP” as a designator to a base district along with a clear delineation of the boundaries of the overlay district and an identifying serial number. The serial number shall refer to the Department of Resource Management’s rezoning petition file for the particular policy plan overlay zone application. (c) Initiation of Zone Change. A petition for a policy plan overlay district may be initiated pursuant to Section 28-111 of this Chapter. Application shall be in the form prescribed by the Director of Resource management. The application shall consist of a written plan and graphics for policy guidance, and a detailed statement of standards and uses to determine consistency with the Solano County General Plan. The application shall, at a minimum, include the items and information described in this Section. 1. Fee or fees as set by the Board of Supervisors pursuant to Section 11-111 of this code. No part of such fee shall be refundable. 2. A complete legal description of the subject property. 3. A narrative description of existing uses of the subject property and adjacent properties. 4. Enumeration of existing and proposed ordinance standards along with a detailed explanation of the differences between them. 5. Findings of fact demonstrating the proposed policy plan overlay district in its entirety is consistent with the Solano County General Plan and findings set forth in subdivision (d) of this Section. 6. A set of standards which will define the purpose, intended uses, development density, dimensional constraints and performance standards for the subject property and, in general, shall take the following form: a. Statement of purpose b. Permitted uses c. Accessory uses d. Conditional uses e. Prohibited uses f. Architectural and sign standards g. Height, building coverage, and yard setbacks h. Landscaping i. Parking and loading requirements j. Additional development standards k. Performance standards (e.g., hazardous materials and waste management) l. Site specific policies to ensure adequate protection of the public health and safety and consistency with the surrounding uses m. Exceptions and general provisions 1. A development plan at a scale no smaller than one inch equals a hundred feet shall depict use areas and proposed circulation based on traffic density information provided in subdivision (c)(6). The development plan shall include a schematic representation of subdivision, grading, landscaping and proposed systems of drainage, water supply, sewage disposal and utility service. 2. Representative design and improvement details shall accompany the development plan and be presented in detail to establish that development and construction will be consistent with the proposed policy plan overlay district. Minimum specific design and improvement details shall include typical building elevations, streetscape, and explanation of all relevant features required pursuant to this subdivision. 3. A development schedule describing the sequence and timing of subdivision and capital improvements, along with estimated capital costs and proposed funding mechanism. 4. Such other information as may be required by the Board of Supervisors, Planning Commission, or Director of Resource Management concerning the proposed development and use of such property, or which the applicant may deem appropriate for a full consideration of the proposal by the Board of Supervisors, Planning Commission, and Director of Resource Management. 5. All information required by this Section shall be stated in a manner to describe the character and style of the proposed development and use in sufficient detail to constitute definite criteria under which subsequent development can be judged for compliance. B. Adoption of Policy Plan Overlay District. Adoption of a policy plan overlay district shall be by action of the Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors, including adoption of an ordinance, pursuant to Section 28-111 of this code. The Board of Supervisors shall not approve a policy plan overlay district unless it makes the following findings: (1) The proposed development is in conformity with the General Plan and any applicable specific plan. (2) The proposed development is designed to produce an environment of stable and desirable character consistent with all applicable goals, objectives, policies, proposals, criteria, standards and procedures of the General Plan, and any applicable specific plan for the area in which the proposed development is a part. (3) The proposed development meets applicable development requirements and where possible, exhibits creativity and innovation in architectural, engineering, planning, and environmental design. (4) Adequate mitigation is provided for any use, process, equipment, or materials which are found to be objectionable or to be injurious to property located in the vicinity by reason of odor, fumes, dust, smoke, cinders, glare, unsightliness, hazardous materials, traffic congestion, or to involve any hazard of fire or explosion. Upon approval of the policy plan overlay district by the Planning Commission and adoption by the Board of Supervisors of an ordinance amending the underlying zoning district, no further review by the Board of Supervisors or Planning Commission shall be required under this Chapter except pursuant to Section 28-112 of this Chapter. (e) Interim Applicable Zoning. During review of an application for a policy plan overlay district, no uses of the property subject to such application shall be allowed except those which would have been permitted under the zoning that existed at the time of the policy plan overlay district application. (f) Administration and Modification. The Director of Resource Management is authorized to issue approvals for building construction, site development plans, and for all minor design, site, sign, and building alterations that are deemed substantially in accord with the approved policy plan overlay district. All requests for minor alterations shall be submitted to the Director of Resource Management in writing, and shall include an explanation of the circumstances necessitating such alteration and the substantial conformity of the proposed modification with the approved policy plan overlay district. (g) Conflict and severability. All uses and development in the policy plan overlay district shall also be subject to all other provisions of this code, except that where conflict in regulations occurs, the regulations specified in this Chapter shall prevail. All uses and development in the policy plan overlay district shall also be subject to all applicable provisions of State law, including the California Environmental Quality Act. Wherever possible, the requirements of that act shall be integrated into the approval process for a policy plan overlay district to ensure comprehensive and coordinated review in a timely manner.

Also, agriculture is the largest single zone district classification on the County zoning map. Therefore, the Board of Supervisors has determined that the promotion and preservation of agriculture is of vital interest to the County. The standards stated in this section preserve agriculture a number of ways, including allowing agricultural-related support uses, excluding incompatible uses, and protecting the viability of the family farm. These regulations support the family farm by allowing a secondary dwelling for family members that acts as a form of affordable housing and, for farms with larger acreage, permits a reasonable number of farm labor housing on or near the farming activity.",

It also determines the type of land use approval required for each type of use and provides general standards for site development. Agriculture is the major industry in Solano County, generating the majority of the tax revenue in the unincorporated County. In addition, certain agricultural lands serve an important function in buffering contiguous environmentally sensitive lands of the Suisun Marsh from the effects of urbanization. Therefore, the Board of Supervisors has determined that it is in the interest of the County to prevent further encroachment upon such agricultural lands by incompatible uses of property. The purpose and intent of the A-SM Districts is to preserve lands best suited for permanent agricultural use while limiting certain intensive agricultural practices which may conflict with adjoining sensitive lands. A primary intent of the A-SM Districts is to assure the retention of upland and lowland grasslands adjacent to the Suisun Marsh in uses compatible with its protection.",

Table 28.22A identifies the land uses allowed by right in each Suisun Marsh Agricultural District and the Land Use Permit required to establish each use. In addition to the Land Use Permit required by Table 28.22A, special requirements may apply to certain uses. B. Marsh Development Permit Requirements. Any development within the Suisun Marsh, as defined by Section 29114 of the Public Resources Code, shall be subject to obtaining a Marsh Development Permit pursuant to the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977, and as provided for in Section 28.104. When a land use subject to a Marsh Development Permit is proposed in both the Primary Management Area and Secondary Management Area, as defined in the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977, the land use shall be subject to a Use Permit covering the whole of the project. C. Architectural Review. Architectural Approval may be required for certain uses, in compliance with Section 28.102 (Architectural Approval). D. Building Permits. A Building Permit shall be required prior to any construction. E. Land Use Regulations. Where the last column in Table 28.22A (Land Use Regulations) includes a section number, e.g., 28.70.10, the zoning regulations in the referenced section apply to the use. Where the last column includes a chapter number, e.g., Chapter 13.6, the regulations in the referenced chapter of the Solano County Code apply to the use. Provisions in other sections of this chapter or in other chapters of the Solano County Code may also apply. F. Nonconforming Uses. Within the Suisun Marsh, as defined by Section 29101 of the Public Resources Code, uses established prior to 1977 that do not conform to the uses set forth in Table 28.22A shall be considered nonconforming uses under Section 28.114, except that nonsubstantial changes, alterations, and additions to nonconforming uses may be allowed within the existing established project footprint area subject to a Marsh Development Permit, pursuant to the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977 and as provided for in Section 28.104. The overall existing development area may not be expanded under these provisions. Development within the existing development area should minimize additional impervious surfaces. An adequate buffer should be established or maintained between the development areas and any water, wetlands, or other marsh habitat to protect the habitat from adverse environmental impacts. An erosion, sediment, and runoff control plan shall be prepared in accordance with Section 31-26(b) regulating grading, drainage, land leveling and erosion control. When the nonconforming use is located in both the Primary and Secondary Management Areas, as defined by the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977, nonsubstantial changes, alterations, and additions to the nonconforming use shall be subject to a Use Permit covering the whole of the project. G. Site Development and Other Standards. All uses shall comply with the provisions of Article IV of this chapter, relating to site development and other standards and beginning with Section 28.90, which includes standards for parking, signs, and other project elements. ## Table 28.22A **Legend:** A = Allowed by right, AP = Administrative Permit, MUP = Minor Use Permit, UP = Use Permit, E = Exempt, --- = Prohibited, - = Prohibited | Use | | Regulations | |-----||-------------| Notes: 1.

It also determines the type of land use approval required for each use within each district, and provides general standards for site development. Rural Residential zoning is applied to areas appropriate for rural, low density, single-family homes, where agriculture is not the sole land use and commercial agricultural production capability is low, where self-sufficiency and privacy are desirable and only minimal essential public services and facilities are available. Homesites are to be self-sufficient, with individual wells and individual septic systems. Water may be supplied by a public water system, operated by a public agency, in areas where water from individual wells may be of marginal quantity or quality. Rural Residential is to be applied in a manner that preserves rural character and scenic qualities and protects sensitive resources including agricultural lands, creeks, native trees, open spaces and views. Rural Residential zoning shall not be applied to agricultural lands, or to areas with a high risk of wild fires, landslides, or flooding. Rural Residential zoning is consistent with and implements the Rural Residential land use designation of the General Plan. The three Rural Residential zoning districts are differentiated primarily by density classifications that correspond to potential agricultural productivity and the types of public services required for each district, as follows: [Table] District | Minimum Parcel Size | Land Features | Services Required R-R 2 1/2 | 2.5 acres | Non-productive | Public water supply and individual private sewage disposal systems R-R 5 | 5 acres | Non-productive | Private water wells and individual private sewage disposal systems R-R 10 | 10 acres | Low capability for agricultural production | Private water wells and individual private sewage disposal systems",

It also determines the type of land use approval required for each use within each district, and provides general standards for site development. Residential-Traditional Community districts recognize current residential and mixed-use communities located outside agricultural or municipal service areas where previous development has occurred at higher densities or intensities than currently allowed under County policy. It is the intent to preserve and enhance the character and quality of these communities and promote future infill residential and mixed use development but not to expand the area of these communities. The R-TC Districts replace the following previous districts: R-TC-1AC replaces RE-1; R-TC-20 replaces RE-1/2 R-TC-15 replaces RE-1/3 R-TC-10 replaces RE-1/4 R-TC-6 replaces R-S-6 R-TC-5 replaces R-S-5 R-TC-D-4 replaces R-D (Starr Subdivision) R-TC-D-6 replaces R-D (Homeacres) R-TC-MF replaces R-M The purpose of the different residential-traditional community zoning districts and the manner in which they are applied are as follows: A. Residential-Traditional Community (R-TC) Districts The R-TC zoning districts are intended for areas that have previously been subdivided for single family residential development and provide the community services appurtenant thereto. The regulations for these districts are designed to stabilize and protect the residential characteristics of the districts, to promote and encourage a suitable environment for family life. Nine R-TC zoning districts are denoted with a suffix to indicate the minimum parcel size (e.g. R-TC-4 requires a minimum parcel size of 4,000 square feet), minimum building setbacks, and other requirements. The R-TC zoning districts are consistent with and implement the Traditional Community - Residential land use designation of the General Plan as follows: [Table] Birds Landing | R-TC-1AC Collinsville Township | R-TC-4 Cordelia area | R-TC-15 Elmira area | R-TC-1AC and R-TC-20 Fairfield Unincorporated area | R-TC-1AC, R-TC-20, R-TC-10 and R-TC-D Green Valley area | R-TC-1AC, R-TC-20, and R-TC-15 Rockville Corners | R-TC-1AC Snug Harbor area | R-TC-10 Vallejo Unincorporated area | R-TC-20, R-TC-10, R-TC-6, R-TC-5, R-TC-D & R-TC-MF Willotta Oaks area | R-TC-15, R-TC-10 B. Residential-Traditional Community Mixed Use (R-TC-MU) Districts The Residential-Traditional Community Mixed Use (R-TC-MU) zoning district is intended for certain medium-density residential and retail commercial and business areas that are appropriate for residential and commercial uses, and that can be served by community services. The regulations for this district are designed to stabilize and protect the essential residential characteristics of the district, to promote and encourage a suitable environment for family life and to provide for the integration of retail shops and businesses into the neighborhood. The R-TC-MU zoning district is consistent with and implements the Traditional Community-Mixed Use land use designation of the General Plan as follows: [Table] Vallejo Unincorporated Area | R-TC-MU Birds Landing Area | R-TC-MU Cordelia area | R-TC-MU Elmira area | R-TC-MU",

Where the last column includes a chapter number, e.g. Chapter 13.6, the regulations in the referenced Solano County Code apply to the use. Provisions in other sections of this Zoning Ordinance may also apply. F. Non-Conforming Uses. Within the Suisun Marsh, as defined by Section 29101 of the Public Resources Code, uses established prior to 1977 that do not conform to the uses set forth in Table 28.32B shall be considered nonconforming uses under Section 28.114, except that non-substantial changes, alterations, and additions to nonconforming uses may be allowed within the existing established project footprint area subject to a marsh development permit, pursuant to the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977 and as provided for in Section 28.104 of this Code. The overall existing development area may not be expanded under these provisions. Development within the existing development area should minimize additional impervious surfaces. An adequate buffer should be established or maintained between the development areas and any water, wetlands, or other Marsh habitat to protect the habitat from adverse environmental impacts. An erosion, sediment, and runoff control plan shall be prepared in accordance with Section 31.26(b) of the Solano County Grading, Drainage, Land Leveling and Erosion Control Ordinance. When the non-conforming uses is located in both the Primary Management Area and Secondary Management Area, as defined by the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977, non-substantial changes, alterations, and additions to the nonconforming use shall be subject to a use permit covering the whole of the project.

It also determines the type of land use approval required for each use within each district, and provides general standards for site development. The purposes of the different commercial zoning districts are as follows: A. Highway Commercial (C-H) District The C-H Districts are intended for commercial uses to serve the highway traveler. The bulk of highway frontage throughout the County is not appropriate for commercial uses but is reserved for exclusive agricultural uses, and is so zoned. C-H Districts are to be established in areas of four acres or larger, and shall be located only where need is clearly indicated. B. Neighborhood Commercial (C-N) District The C-N District is designed to provide an area for a limited number of small retail and service establishments to provide for businesses serving the daily needs of nearby residential neighborhoods or rural community. The intent of this district is to promote convenience shopping goods and services for nearby residents and not for patrons outside the community to be served. Uses established shall be found compatible and developed with standards that prevent significant adverse impacts on land uses adjoining the C-N Districts. C. Commercial Recreation (C-R) District The C-R zoning district is intended to provide appropriate commercial recreation uses that support recreational activities and resource based recreational uses within the County in a manner compatible with surrounding land uses. The C-R zoning district is consistent with the commercial recreation designations of the General Plan outside the Suisun Marsh Management Area. D. Commercial Recreation- Limited (C-R-L) District The C-R-L zoning district is intended to provide for limited commercial recreational uses adjacent to the Suisun Marsh compatible with its protection. The C-R-L zoning district is consistent with the Commercial Recreation land use designation of the General Plan within the Secondary Management Area of the Suisun Marsh. E. Commercial Service (C-S) District The C-S District is designed to provide an area for commercial services of an extensive or heavy nature in support of industrial, construction, or other business activities. F. Business and Professional Office (C-O) District The C-O District is designated primarily to provide an area for business and professional offices.",

It also determines the type of land use approval required for each use within each district, and provides general standards for site development. The purpose of the different industrial and manufacturing zoning districts and the manner in which they are applied are as follows: A. Manufacturing - Limited (M-L) District The M-L District is designed to provide an environment conducive to the development and protection of modern, large scale administrative facilities, research institutions, warehousing, and specialized or light manufacturing organizations, all of a non-nuisance type, in accordance with the concept of an industrial park. B. Manufacturing - General (M-G) District The purpose of the M-G District is to permit the normal operations of almost all industries, subject only to those regulations needed to control congestion and to protect the surrounding area or adjoining premises. The two size designations are designed to provide a differentiation between an intensive and an extensive type of development. C. Industrial - Water Dependent (I-WD) District Certain waterfront lands within Solano County are of Statewide and regional significance because they are among the few remaining deep-water sites suitable for water-dependent industries. Furthermore, significant agricultural and marsh lands are nearby resources which the County is committed to preserve. For this reason, the I-WD District is established to reserve waterfront lands for large-scale, water-dependent industries to assure the efficient use of waterfront industrial sites, and to ensure that impact upon nearby environmentally sensitive lands are minimized. The provisions of this Section shall be strictly interpreted to assure that only those industries which depend on a waterfront site are to locate within this district. It is expressly understood that prior to consideration of any industrial proposal within the district, the Planning Commission shall determine the industry’s need for a waterfront site and assure its conformance with the provisions of the Solano County General Plan, this Chapter, and where applicable, the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977. Industries seeking to locate in the area designated Water Related Industrial Reserve on the Suisun Marsh Protection Plan Map are to be governed by the definition of water-related industry contained in the San Francisco Bay Plan. Those industries which are not considered to be water dependent may continue to locate within other industrial districts. Some of the land in this district is lowland grassland or seasonal marsh which has existing value as wetland habitat or is suitable for restoration to wetland habitat. These areas have subsided and may be filled, using approved dredged sediments, and restored to tidal, managed, or seasonal wetlands, for the purpose of increasing their natural resource value and restoring some of the formerly natural tidal wetland area. Restored wetlands shall remain as wetlands and not be developed for industrial uses.",

Allowed Uses and Permit Requirements Tables 28-42A and 28-42B identifies the land uses allowed by this Zoning Ordinance in each manufacturing and industrial district and the land use permit required to establish each use. In addition to the land use permit required by Tables 28-42A and 28-42B, special requirements may apply to certain uses. B. Marsh Development Permit Requirements Any development within the Suisun Marsh, as defined by Section 29114 of the Public Resources Code, shall be subject to obtaining a marsh development permit pursuant to the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977 and as provided for in Section 28.104 of this Code. When a land use subject to a marsh development permit is proposed in both the Primary Management Area and Secondary Management Area, as defined in the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977, the land use shall be subject to a use permit covering the whole of the project. C. Architectural Review Architectural Approval may be required for certain uses, in compliance with Section 28.102 (Architectural Approval). D. Building Permits A building permit shall be required prior to any construction. Prior to the issuance of a building permit, the Zoning Administrator or Planning Commission may require evidence that adequate controls, measures or devices will be provided to meet performance standards for this zone, as provided in Section 28.95, all to insure and protect the public interest, health, comfort, convenience, safety, and general welfare. E. Land Use Regulations Where the last column in Table 28.42A (Land Use Regulations) includes a section number, e.g. 28.70.10, the zoning regulations in the referenced section apply to the use. Where the last column includes a chapter number, e.g. Chapter 13.6, the regulations in the referenced Solano County Code apply to the use. Provisions in other sections of this Zoning Ordinance may also apply. F. Non-Conforming Uses Within the Suisun Marsh, as defined by Section 29114 of the Public Resources Code, uses established prior to August 4, 1981 that do not conform to the uses set forth in Table 28.41A shall be considered nonconforming uses under Section 28.114, except that non-substantial changes, alterations, and additions to nonconforming uses may be allowed within the existing established project footprint area subject to a marsh development permit, pursuant to the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977 and as provided for in Section 28.104 of this Code. The overall existing development area may not be expanded under these provisions. Development within the existing development area should minimize additional impervious surfaces. An adequate buffer should be established or maintained between the development areas and any water, wetlands, or other Marsh habitat to protect the habitat from adverse environmental impacts. An erosion, sediment, and runoff control plan shall be prepared in accordance with Section 31.26(b) of the Solano County Grading, Drainage, Land Leveling and Erosion Control Ordinance. When the non-conforming uses is located in both the Primary Management Area and Secondary Management Area, as defined by the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977, non-substantial changes, alterations, and additions to the nonconforming use shall be subject to a use permit covering the whole of the project. G. Site Development and Other Standards All uses shall comply with the provisions of Article IV, Section 28-90 Site Development and Other Standards which includes standards for parking, signs and other project elements.

          "text": "A. Purpose: The Board of Supervisors finds that the watershed and conservation district areas of Solano County are very valuable natural resources, and in order to protect these areas from the constant threat of wildfire, subsidence, and landslide leading to the destruction and financial loss to private and public property; and in order to prevent increased threats of these hazards through overdevelopment of these areas; and in order to protect the general welfare of the County as a whole, there is hereby created a zone classification within which the establishment, perpetuation and protection of watershed and conservation district shall be encouraged. The provisions of this Section shall be liberally interpreted insofar as they apply to the protection of watershed and conservation district areas. It is the intention of this Section to deter developer from considering lands in a “W” zone as potential urban subdivision property, as residential uses are not compatible with watershed and conservation district areas by the fact that such areas are characterized by slope instability, fire hazards, and the unavailability of water and public services. Those areas to be designated under this zone are fire hazard areas and are subject to slope instability as determined by the Solano County General Plan, and are characterized by the following conditions: 1. Steep topography (defined as slopes in excess of twenty-five percent grade). 2. Excessive vegetation coverage (defined as fifty percent or more of the area or parcel being covered with chaparral or woodland). 3. Inadequate roads (defined as roads below the County standards as to width, alignment, grade or improvement). 4. Lack of available water (defined as insufficient water to sustain a flow of two hundred gallons a minute for twenty minutes). 5. Land susceptible to subsidence or landsliding (defined as characterized by slopes greater than fifteen percent underlain by landslide-prone deposits, or by existing landslide deposits). A range of agricultural uses are found to be compatible with watershed management. However, these uses are specifically defined and prescribed to prevent an increase in the fire or landslide hazards that now exit, and such uses would not require additional public services. These agricultural uses should not attract increased habitation or encourage activities that are not compatible with watershed management. B. W District Land Uses and Permit Requirements. Table 28-51A identifies the land uses allowed by this Zoning Ordinance in the W District and the land use permit required to establish each use. In addition to the land use permit required by Table 28-51A, special requirements may apply to certain uses. Architectural Approval may also be required for certain uses in compliance with Section 28.102 (Architectural Approval). A building permit shall also be required prior to any construction, alteration, remodeling or change in occupancy from a previous building permit. Note: Where the last column in Table 28-51A (“Land Use Regulations”) includes a section number, e.g. 28.74, the zoning regulations in the referenced section apply to the use. Where the last column includes a chapter number, e.g. Chapter 13.6, the regulations in the referenced Solano County Code apply to the use. Provisions in other sections of this Zoning Ordinance may also apply. ## TABLE 28.51A **Legend:** A = Allowed by right, AP = Administrative Permit, MUP = Minor Use Permit, UP = Use Permit, E = Exempt, --- = Prohibited, - = Prohibited | Use | | Regulations | |-----||-------------| | **A.

Therefore, the Board of Supervisors has determined it is in the interest of the County to preserve and enhance the quality and diversity of marsh habitats, within which marsh-oriented uses shall be encouraged to the exclusion of such other uses of land as may be in conflict with the long-term preservation and protection of marsh areas.

In addition to the land use permit required by Table 28.52A, special requirements may apply to certain uses. B Marsh Development Permit Requirements Any development within the Suisun Marsh, as defined by Section 29114 of the Public Resources Code, shall be subject to obtaining a marsh development permit pursuant to the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977 and as provided for in Section 28.104 of this Code. When a land use subject to a marsh development permit is proposed in both the Primary Management Area and Secondary Management Area, as defined in the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977, the land use shall be subject to a use permit covering the whole of the project. C. Architectural Review Architectural Approval may be required for certain uses, in compliance with Section 28.102 (Architectural Approval). D. Building Permits A building permit shall be required prior to any construction. E. Land Use Regulations Where the last column in Table 28.52A (Land Use Regulations) includes a section number, e.g. 28.70.10, the zoning regulations in the referenced section apply to the use. Where the last column includes a chapter number, e.g. Chapter 13.6, the regulations in the referenced Solano County Code apply to the use. Provisions in other sections of this Zoning Ordinance may also apply. F. Nonconforming Uses Within the Suisun Marsh, as defined by Section 29101 of the Public Resources Code, uses established prior to 1977 that do not conform to the uses set forth in Table 28.52A shall be considered nonconforming uses under Section 28.114, except that nonsubstantial changes, alterations, and additions to nonconforming uses may be allowed within the existing established project footprint area subject to a marsh development permit pursuant to the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977 and as provided for in Section 28.104. The overall existing development area may not be expanded under these provisions. Development within the existing development area should minimize additional impervious surfaces. An adequate buffer should be established or maintained between the development areas and any water, wetlands, or other marsh habitat to protect the habitat from adverse environmental impacts. An erosion, sediment, and runoff control plan shall be prepared in accordance with Section 31.26, regulating grading, drainage, land leveling and erosion control. When the nonconforming use is located in both the Primary Management Area and Secondary Management Area, as defined by the Suisun Marsh Preservation Act of 1977, nonsubstantial changes, alterations, and additions to the nonconforming use shall be subject to a use permit covering the whole of the project. G. Site Development and Other Standards All uses shall comply with the provisions of Article IV of this chapter, relating to site development and other standards and beginning with Section 28.90, which includes standards for parking, signs, and other project elements. ## Table 28.52A **Legend:** A = Allowed by right, AP = Administrative Permit, MUP = Minor Use Permit, UP = Use Permit, E = Exempt, --- = Prohibited, - = Prohibited | Use | | Regulations | |-----||-------------| Notes: 1.
