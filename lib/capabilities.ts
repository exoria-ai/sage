				toolCalls: ['Search County Code', 'Get County Code Sections'],

The permit required for a winery depends on its size (annual production) and grape sourcing:

**Permit Requirements by Winery Size**
| Winery Type | A-20, A-40, A-80, A-160 Zones | Key Conditions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Small Winery (≤ 20k gal) | **Allowed by Right** (no permit) | Must source ≥25% of grapes from Solano County |
| Medium Winery (20k-100k) | **Administrative Permit (AP)** or MUP | MUP required if no direct access from public road |
| Large Winery (> 100k) | **Use Permit (UP)** | Discretionary approval required |
| Winery with <25% local grapes | **Use Permit (UP)** | Regardless of size |

**Key Requirements**
• **Grape Sourcing:** Small wineries must source at least 25% of grapes locally.
• **Reporting:** Annual reporting of total gallons produced required.
• **Tasting Rooms:** Max size varies (1,000 sq ft for Small, 2,000 sq ft for Medium/Large).
• **Special Events:** Medium/Large wineries may host events per permit; Small wineries need Sheriff notification.

*Summary: Small local wineries (under 20k gallons) operate by right. Larger operations need discretionary permits.*`

				result: `General Plan Policy on Subdivisions in Agricultural Areas
Short answer: No. The General Plan strongly discourages parcel divisions in agricultural zones and establishes large minimum parcel sizes to preserve farmland.

**Minimum Parcel Sizes (Table AG-3)**
| Agricultural Region | Minimum Parcel Size |
| :--- | :--- |
| Suisun Valley | 20 acres |
| Green Valley | 20 acres |
| Winters / Dixon Ridge | 40 acres |
| Montezuma Hills | 160 acres |
| Jepson Prairie | 160 acres |

**Key Policies**
• **Policy AG.P-31:** Parcel sizes must conform to these minimums.
• **Policy AG.P-28:** Agriculture is to be the predominant land use in these regions.
• **Policy AG.P-32:** Redesignation to rural residential is extremely limited and requires finding that land is *unsuitable* for agriculture.

*Summary: The General Plan's approach to agricultural lands is preservation, not subdivision.*`
