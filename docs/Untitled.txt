Winery Permits in Solano County Agricultural Zones
The permit required for a winery depends on its size (annual production) and grape sourcing:
Winery Size Classifications
Size
Annual Production
Definition
Small
≤ 20,000 gallons
Bulk and bottles combined
Medium
20,001 – 100,000 gallons
Bulk and bottles combined
Large
> 100,000 gallons
Bulk and bottles combined
Permit Requirements by Winery Size
Winery Type
A-20, A-40, A-80, A-160 Zones
Key Conditions
Small Winery
Allowed by Right (no permit)
Must source ≥25% of grapes from Solano County
Medium Winery
Administrative Permit (AP) or Minor Use Permit (MUP)
MUP required if no direct access from public road
Large Winery
Use Permit (UP)
Discretionary approval required
Winery with <25% on-site grapes
Use Permit (UP)
Regardless of size
Key Requirements for All Wineries
Grape Sourcing:
	•	Small wineries must source at least 25% of grapes from land owned or leased by the operator within Solano County (averaged over 5 years)
	•	Failure to meet this threshold subjects the winery to higher permit requirements
Reporting:
	•	Annual reporting to the Department of Resource Management of total gallons produced, OR proof of ABC license renewal fee payment
Tasting Facility Limits:
Winery Size
Max Tasting Room Size
Small
1,000 sq ft
Medium
2,000 sq ft
Large
2,000 sq ft
General Standards (all wineries):
	•	Trucking access must not interfere with normal traffic
	•	Stormwater must be managed to prevent processing wastes from entering waterways
	•	Must comply with district development standards (setbacks, height, etc.)
Special Events:
	•	Medium and large wineries may host special events as permitted under their use permit
	•	Small wineries must obtain Environmental Health and Fire Department approval and notify the Sheriff's Office before hosting special events
Summary
If you're planning a small winery (under 20,000 gallons/year) that sources at least 25% of its grapes locally, you can operate by right with no discretionary permit—just meet the development standards and reporting requirements. Larger operations or those sourcing most grapes from outside the county will need a Use Permit with Planning Commission approval.

General Plan Policy on Subdivisions in Agricultural Areas
Short answer: No, the General Plan does not support subdivisions in agricultural areas. The General Plan strongly discourages parcel divisions in agricultural zones and establishes large minimum parcel sizes to preserve farmland.
Minimum Parcel Sizes by Agricultural Region
The General Plan (Table AG-3) establishes minimum parcel sizes that effectively prohibit subdivisions:
Agricultural Region
Minimum Parcel Size
Suisun Valley
20 acres
Green Valley
20 acres
Winters
40 acres
Dixon Ridge
40 acres
Elmira (northwest)
40 acres
Maine Prairie (southeast)
80 acres
Ryer Island
80 acres
Montezuma Hills
160 acres
Jepson Prairie
160 acres
Western Hills (west of Pleasants Valley Rd)
160 acres
Pleasants, Vaca, Lagoon Valleys
20-40 acres (varies by current zoning)
Key General Plan Policies
Policy AG.P-31 establishes that parcel sizes must conform to these minimums. It does allow one residence plus a secondary unit on lots of record existing as of January 1, 1984, but only if the lot is first merged with contiguous parcels to the maximum extent possible under state law.
Policy AG.P-28 explicitly states that agriculture is to be the predominant land use in Dixon Ridge, Elmira and Maine Prairie, Montezuma Hills, Ryer Island, and Winters regions, and that preservation efforts should be focused there with conflicting land uses avoided.
Policy AG.P-32 allows redesignation to rural residential (1 unit per 2.5-10 acres) only if the Board of Supervisors makes all of the following findings:
	•	Won't encourage piecemeal conversion of agricultural areas
	•	Land is not prime agricultural land (per the Williamson Act)
	•	Land is unsuitable for agriculture due to terrain, soil, drainage, flooding, or parcel size
	•	Proposed use is compatible with agricultural uses
	•	Land is adjacent to existing comparably developed areas
	•	Adequate public services are available
	•	Annexation to a city is not appropriate
Even then, redesignations are limited to 160 acres per landowner per calendar year.
Policy AG.P-4 requires farmland conversion mitigation at a minimum 1:1 ratio for any conversion of agricultural land to non-agricultural uses.
Summary
The General Plan's approach to agricultural lands is preservation, not subdivision. Creating smaller parcels in agricultural zones would require a General Plan Amendment with extensive findings that the land is unsuitable for agriculture—a high bar to meet.

What This Means
Zone X (shaded/0.2% annual chance) indicates the property is in an area with moderate-to-low flood risk—outside the 100-year floodplain but within the 500-year floodplain. This means:
	•	There is a 0.2% chance of flooding in any given year (1 in 500 years statistically)
	•	Flood insurance is not required by mortgage lenders
	•	If you choose to purchase flood insurance, you qualify for lower preferred rates
	•	While low risk, flooding can still occur—about 20% of flood claims come from outside high-risk zones
