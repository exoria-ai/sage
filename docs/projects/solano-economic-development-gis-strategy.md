# Solano County GIS & Economic Development: Research & Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the current economic development landscape in Solano County and identifies strategic opportunities for GIS to play a more central role in regional economic growth. The analysis reveals an underutilized opportunity: while the county has strong GIS infrastructure for regulatory functions, there is no dedicated economic development GIS focus despite explicit General Plan policies calling for such coordination.

## Current Economic Development Structure

### County-Level Organization

Economic development functions for Solano County reside within the **County Administrator's Office (CAO)**. Key observations:

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Department | County Administrator's Office (Dept 1100) |
| Division | CAO Administration (18 FTE) |
| Key Contact | Matthew Davis, Sr. Management Analyst & Public Information Officer |
| ED Position | "Economic Development Officer TBD" - position exists but appears unfilled |
| Total CAO Staff | 34.5 FTE across all divisions |

The "TBD" designation for the Economic Development Officer role suggests either a vacancy or an evolving function - potentially an opportunity for GIS to fill a coordination gap.

### Solano Economic Development Corporation (EDC)

The **Solano EDC** is a **private nonprofit membership organization** - not a government entity. It serves as the primary regional economic development coordinator.

**Structure:**
- Membership includes all 7 cities, the county, major employers, nonprofits, and public agencies
- President & CEO: Chris Rico
- Focus: Business Attraction, Business Retention & Expansion, Public Good Projects

**Key Functions:**
- Regional economic strategy ("Moving Solano Forward" studies)
- Business recruitment and site selection assistance
- Workforce development coordination
- Data gathering and economic studies

**Recent Activity (2024-2025):**
- October 2024: Strategic partnership with California Manufacturers & Technology Association (CMTA)
- March 2025: Annual Meeting featuring State Senator Christopher Cabaldon and UC Berkeley speakers
- Ongoing focus on advanced manufacturing strategy

### City-Level Economic Development

Each of Solano's seven cities maintains its own economic development capacity:

| City | Typical Focus |
|------|---------------|
| Vallejo | Waterfront redevelopment, downtown revitalization |
| Fairfield | Commercial corridors, Anheuser-Busch/Jelly Belly industrial area |
| Vacaville | Retail/biotech, outlet mall area |
| Benicia | Industrial park, waterfront, historic downtown |
| Dixon | Agricultural services, I-80 corridor |
| Suisun City | Waterfront, train depot area |
| Rio Vista | Tourism, Delta access |

### County vs. City Roles

**County Focus:**
- Unincorporated area development
- Regional/countywide economic strategy
- Coordination between jurisdictions
- Data infrastructure and studies
- Agricultural economy support

**City Focus:**
- Local permitting and incentives
- Downtown/commercial district programs
- City-specific business attraction
- Local workforce programs

## General Plan Framework (Chapter 6: Economic Development)

The 2008 Solano County General Plan establishes economic development as a core function with three strategic pillars:

### Strategic Directives

1. **Targeted Development** - Manufacturing and office uses encouraging diverse business opportunities
2. **Business Recruitment & Retention** - Encouraging businesses that support communities
3. **Education & Workforce Investment** - Developing skilled workforce

### Key Goals

- **ED.G-1:** Maintain and improve the County's standing as a location for business
- Focus on measuring progress through benchmarks and continuous evaluation

### Relevant Policies for GIS Integration

| Policy | Description | GIS Relevance |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| ED.P-12 | Collaborate with cities, schools, healthcare providers on quality of life | Service area mapping, accessibility analysis |
| ED.P-13 | Collaborate with cities to improve infrastructure in targeted areas | Infrastructure capacity mapping |
| ED.I-8 | Support Solano EDC and Workforce Investment Board with measurable objectives | Data dashboards, benchmark tracking |

### Designated Development Areas

The General Plan identifies specific areas for commercial/industrial development:

- **Dixon Area:** ~750 acres NE of Dixon along I-80 (Highway Commercial, Service Commercial, Limited Industrial)
- **Suisun Valley:** Agriculture-focused commercial
- **Vacaville Area:** Various commercial designations
- Additional areas throughout unincorporated county

---

## The GIS Opportunity Gap

### Current State

Solano County GIS infrastructure is strong for **regulatory/compliance functions**:
- Parcel data and ownership
- Zoning designations
- Flood zone mapping (FEMA)
- Fire hazard severity zones
- Supervisor districts
- Special districts

These serve planning and permitting well but are **reactive** - answering "Can I build here?" rather than "Where should we recruit businesses?"

### Missing Economic Development Layers

| Category | Potential Data | Use Case |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Site Inventory | Vacant parcels, underutilized commercial, available buildings | Business recruitment, site selection |
| Infrastructure Capacity | Water/sewer capacity, broadband availability, power infrastructure | Development feasibility |
| Workforce Access | Commute sheds, labor pool demographics, transit access | Location analysis for employers |
| Incentive Zones | Opportunity zones, enterprise zones, tax increment areas | Investment attraction |
| Market Analysis | Retail gaps, customer bases, competitor locations | Business planning support |

### Political Complexity

The fragmented jurisdiction creates challenges:

1. **Seven Cities + County** - Each with distinct economic interests
2. **Solano EDC as Convener** - Nonprofit status means coordination without authority
3. **Lean County ED Function** - Limited dedicated staff
4. **No Single Data Owner** - Economic development GIS falls between departments

---

## Strategic Recommendations

### Strategy 1: Position GIS as Neutral Data Infrastructure

**Approach:** Offer countywide GIS as a shared resource that benefits all jurisdictions without threatening anyone's turf.

**Tactics:**
- Provide consistent base data that cities can build upon
- Offer regional analysis that individual cities can't do alone
- Maintain data standards that enable cross-jurisdictional comparison

**Political Benefit:** Neutral service provider role avoids turf conflicts

### Strategy 2: Build an Economic Development Layer Stack

**Approach:** Create proactive economic development data layers beyond regulatory compliance.

**Priority Layers:**

1. **Available Sites Inventory**
   - Vacant parcels by zoning/size
   - Underutilized commercial properties
   - Buildings for lease/sale (partnership with commercial brokers)

2. **Infrastructure Capacity**
   - Water system capacity by area
   - Sewer capacity and planned improvements
   - Broadband availability mapping
   - Electrical capacity for industrial users

3. **Workforce Accessibility**
   - Drive-time polygons from employment centers
   - Labor pool demographics by commute shed
   - Transit accessibility scoring

4. **Incentive Geography**
   - Federal Opportunity Zones
   - State enterprise zones
   - Local incentive districts

### Strategy 3: Become the EDC's Data Partner

**Approach:** The General Plan explicitly calls for supporting the Solano EDC. Position GIS as their analytical backbone.

**Deliverables:**
- Site selection mapping tools for prospect presentations
- Custom maps for business recruitment packages
- Economic impact visualization for Board/Council presentations
- Regional comparison tools (Solano vs. competing counties)

**Value Proposition:** EDC gets professional-grade tools; County gets credit for regional leadership

### Strategy 4: Leverage Regional Corridor Position

**Approach:** Solano's geographic advantage is its location between Bay Area, Sacramento, and Napa. Make this visible.

**Mapping Products:**
- Travel time analysis to major markets
- Logistics network visualization (I-80, I-680, rail, ports)
- Distribution center optimization analysis
- Market access radius maps

**Use Case:** Business recruitment materials, EDC presentations, economic studies

### Strategy 5: Serve Multiple Masters Strategically

**Approach:** Build relationships across the fragmented landscape by offering tailored value to each stakeholder.

| Stakeholder | Offering |
|-------------|----------|
| Board of Supervisors | Economic dashboards, presentation-ready maps, district-level analysis |
| CAO/Economic Development | Benchmarking tools, progress tracking, regional coordination data |
| Cities | Shared data infrastructure, regional context for local planning |
| Solano EDC | Site selection tools, prospect presentation materials, study support |
| Planning/Resource Management | Streamlined development review, integrated economic analysis |
