## What Stewart Said on the Call

### What He's Looking For
- Someone **technical** who can **develop "cool stuff"** — not just a manager
- The existing team (3 filled positions) is not highly technical (he mentioned being "scared of them" after FME training)
- He is **"AI forward"** — brought this up unprompted
- Needs someone who can be the technical anchor for the team

### Current State of GIS
- Previous person in the role left about a month ago
- GIS was "a complete mess" when Stewart took over
- He has invested significant time fixing it
- System is now in "pretty good state" with an **ample budget**
- Recent modernization: migrated Esri GIS infrastructure to Microsoft Azure (KCI consulting assisted)

### Compensation Discussion
- Stewart suggested Tier 3 of 5 on pay scale (~$147K)
- Indicated 1 tier increase after first year and second year
- This would put you at top of range (~$156K) by year 3
- He volunteered this information — not trying to lowball

### Interview Process

## What the Videos Need to Achieve

### Demonstrate Technical Depth
- You are not just a manager who assigns work
- You can actually build things at an expert level
- Your 2017-2025 development years were productive, not a gap

### Show You Can Lead Their Team
- You can be the technical anchor for staff who aren't highly technical
- You can elevate the team's capabilities
- You understand modern tools and can train others

### Align with Stewart's Vision
- "AI forward" — show you're already there
- "Cool stuff" — build something visually impressive
- Modern, cloud-native thinking (Azure context)

### Prove Enterprise/Public-Sector Relevance
- Frame everything in government/county context
- Reference real public-sector use cases
- Show you understand the stakeholders (departments, public, elected officials)

### Communicate Effectively
- Clear explanation for technical AND non-technical audiences
- Logical structure
- Professional presentation

## What the In-Person Interview Needs to Achieve

### Confirm Cultural/Personality Fit
- Stewart already likes your background (hence the direct outreach)
- Show you're collaborative, not just technically capable
- Demonstrate you can work with departments as internal consultant

### Address the "Gap" If It Comes Up
- Frame 2017-2025 as maintaining/expanding technical skills
- Emphasize desire to return to public sector "where work has direct community impact"
- The videos already prove technical currency

### Show You Understand Their Context
- Reference the Azure migration, current state
- Ask informed questions about priorities, challenges
- Demonstrate familiarity with Solano (geography, departments, ReGIS consortium)

### Leverage the Bermuda/Cayman Parallel
- If it comes up naturally, mention it
- "I noticed you were at Bermuda — I spent thirteen years with Cayman Islands Government, so we probably have similar reference points"
- Shows you understand island government IT challenges

## Talking Points for Interview

### Questions to Ask
1. "You mentioned the GIS is in good shape now after a lot of work. What's the current focus — optimization, new capabilities, expansion?"

4. "Tell me about the Solano ReGIS consortium and the county's role in regional data sharing."
5. "What's your vision for AI integration with GIS services?"

### Points to Make
- 12 years of GIS management/supervision, not just technical work
- Built GIS programs from scratch twice (College Station, Cayman)
- Managed enterprise GIS serving 20+ departments
- Recent development work keeps technical skills current
- Ready to return to public sector where work has direct community impact
