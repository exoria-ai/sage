## Interview Strategy

### Key Themes to Emphasize
1. **Technical depth + leadership** — You're not just a manager who delegates; you can build things
2. **Caribbean government parallel** — You and Stewart share rare background; you understand his reference points
3. **AI capability** — You're not just "interested in AI"; you've shipped production AI applications
4. **Team development** — You can uplift his current team's technical capabilities
5. **Stable tenure** — 13 years with Cayman shows you're not a job-hopper

### UPDATED Questions to Be Ready For
- "What does success look like for you in the first year?"
- "How would you approach the current team's skill development?"
- "Tell me about the AI work you've done and how it applies to GIS"
- "How did you handle [specific challenge] in Cayman?"
- "How would you work with the ReGIS consortium?" ← You now know Stewart chairs it
- "What's your experience with 3D GIS/LiDAR?" ← They just got 3DEP data

### UPDATED Questions to Ask Them
- "I saw the county achieved 3DEP program inclusion for LiDAR—what's the vision for using that data?"
- "How is the GIS Governance Framework rollout going? I saw there's a Steering Committee and Solutions Committee structure."
- "What's the current relationship with KCI? I understand they've been involved in the modernization."
- "You mentioned being AI forward—I saw the county joined the GovAI Coalition. What's been the experience so far?"
- "How does coordination work with the ReGIS consortium?" ← Shows you researched
- "I noticed Daniel Machado has been running the Teach Me GIS training—what's the appetite for continued training investment?"

---

## Immediate Next Steps

1. ✅ **Topics selected** — #7 (AI) and #3 (Web GIS Application)
2. ✅ **Video script drafted** — SAGE demo + Interactive Map viewer
3. **Build/prepare demos** — Verify all SAGE queries work, test interactive map
4. **Record and edit** — Keep to 10-12 minute format per video
5. **Upload to YouTube** — Unlisted is fine
6. **Submit URLs by noon PST Monday Jan 26**

## Competition Assessment

- Only 3 interview slots suggests very small candidate pool
- Stewart bypassing HR to contact you directly is a strong positive signal
- The video requirement will filter out candidates who can't demonstrate real skills
- Your "gap years" building AI applications are now your competitive advantage
- Topic #7 (Agentic AI) is likely something no other candidate can credibly demonstrate
- **You literally built an MCP server using their actual data** — This is beyond what they're expecting

## Key Talking Points for Interview

### On AI
"I saw Solano County joined the GovAI Coalition in 2024 and has deployed Microsoft Co-Pilot. The SAGE system I built is essentially that concept applied specifically to GIS—an AI that understands the county's data, regulations, and jurisdictional complexity."

### On ReGIS
"I understand you chair the ReGIS consortium. That multi-agency coordination is familiar territory—in Cayman I supported 20+ departments and also helped deploy GIS for Turks & Caicos, so I'm used to bridging different organizational needs."

### On Team Development
"I noticed from the ReGIS minutes that Daniel Machado has been running Intro to ArcGIS Pro training. I'd want to build on that foundation—help the team move from basic proficiency to being able to automate their own workflows. The goal is to make them less scared of tools like FME, not more."

### On Recent Accomplishments
"The 3DEP inclusion is exciting—that LiDAR data opens up hydrological analysis, terrain modeling, even building footprint extraction. Combined with the 2025 aerial capture, you have a really strong foundation for advanced analysis."
