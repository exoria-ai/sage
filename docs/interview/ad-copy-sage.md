# SAGE: Marketing Copy & Talking Points

**Solano Agent for Geographic Enquiry**

---

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

In the 90s, GIS solved the data integration problem for government. The map became the layer that connected systems never designed to talk to each other.

SAGE does the same thing with AI. Natural language becomes the key that links property records, zoning codes, flood maps, general plans, and budgets. One question, five systems, one answer.

Built in 5 days. Uses your actual data. No rip-and-replace required.

## One-Liner Variants

**For Technical Audiences:**
> MCP-powered AI agent with 50+ tools connected to county GIS, regulatory codes, and administrative data—multimodal, with map capture and visual interpretation.

**For Executive Audiences:**
> AI that answers questions no single database can—by connecting your existing systems through natural language instead of custom integrations.

**For Planning/Permitting:**
> "Can I build a winery here?" answered in seconds, not 30 minutes—with zoning, hazards, and permit requirements synthesized automatically.

**For IT Leadership:**
> Integration-first AI that works with your existing infrastructure. No new databases. No rip-and-replace. Just tools that reach into what you already have.

## Key Messages

### 1. The GIS Precedent
GIS succeeded in government because it didn't demand that every department rebuild their systems. It integrated what already existed.

AI will succeed the same way. SAGE connects to existing data sources through APIs and structured document pipelines. The assessor's database stays. The county code stays. The AI provides the interface that links them together.

### 2. The Speed Advantage
**5 days to build what would have taken 12-24 months three years ago.**

The tools exist. The infrastructure exists. What's changed is that AI can now reason about complex regulatory frameworks, interpret maps visually, and synthesize answers from multiple sources—capabilities that weren't possible at this level even two years ago.

### 3. The Government Advantage
Government needs this more than the private sector because we can't rip and replace legacy systems. Integration-first thinking isn't just technically sound—it's politically realistic.

SAGE demonstrates that AI can work *with* government constraints, not against them.

### 4. The Force Multiplier
Power users + AI agents multiply capability without adding headcount.

The question "does my client need a grading permit?" currently requires a knowledgeable staff member who knows to check Chapter 31, understands the agricultural exemptions three sections later, and can trace cross-references to definitions. SAGE encodes that expertise—making it available to anyone, anytime.

## Feature Highlights

### Multi-System Property Analysis
- Address → APN → Zoning → Flood → Fire → Districts in one query
- Automatic jurisdiction routing (catches "Fairfield address, county jurisdiction" cases)
- Parcel details, assessed value, hazard status synthesized

### Regulatory Research Assistant
- 365 pages of zoning code, searchable by intent not just keyword
- Cross-reference tracing: finds the exemption that applies to your situation
- Edge case awareness: "wedding receptions" triggers separate permit requirements

### Visual Map Intelligence
- AI requests maps, interprets what it sees
- "40% of this 80-acre parcel falls within Zone AE"
- Spatial reasoning across large properties where point queries fail

### Document Navigation
- County code preserved with section hierarchy
- General plan policies tagged separately from narrative
- Budget tables indexed for cross-referencing

### Meeting Search
- Board of Supervisors and consortium minutes
- Recursive agentic search that refines queries
- Up-to-date information missing from static documents

## Demo Scenarios (Copy-Paste Ready)

### Scenario 1: Airbnb Eligibility
```
"Can I rent my cabin near Green Valley as an Airbnb?"
```
**What happens:** AI geocodes, checks jurisdiction (catches county vs city), queries fire hazard zone (Very High = disqualified), retrieves permit requirements from county code sections 28.75.30 and 28.72.40.

### Scenario 2: Agritourism Property Profile
```
"What can I do with this property for agritourism?"
```
**What happens:** Parallel queries to assessor, county GIS, FEMA, CalFire, supervisor districts. Identifies ASV-20 zoning, explains that vacation rentals are prohibited but agricultural homestays are allowed, notes requirement for active agricultural production.

### Scenario 3: Flood Zone Spatial Analysis
```
"Where exactly does the flood zone cross this 80-acre parcel?"
```
**What happens:** AI captures map with FEMA overlay, interprets spatial variation, identifies that 40% is Zone AE while the vineyard portions are Zone X, explains development constraints.

### Scenario 4: Grading Permit Research
```
"Does my client need a grading permit?"
```
**What happens:** Pulls county code sections 31-21 through 31-24, identifies two-tier exemption structure, explains 50 cubic yard / 8,000 square foot thresholds, notes slope requirements that trigger conservation plan requirement.

### Scenario 5: General Plan Policy Search
```
"Does the general plan support subdivisions in agricultural areas?"
```
**What happens:** Searches agriculture chapter, finds policies AG.I-10 and AG.P-31, retrieves actual minimum parcel sizes by region from Table AG-3 (20 acres Suisun Valley, 160 acres Montezuma Hills).

### Scenario 6: CEQA Layer Discovery
```
"I'm doing CEQA review near Suisun Marsh. What layers should I check?"
```
**What happens:** Queries 126-layer metadata catalog, cross-references hazards and environmental categories with CEQA suggestions, returns prioritized list with data source notes (e.g., BCDC boundaries are cartographic only—official boundaries require contacting BCDC directly).

### Scenario 7: Organizational Research
```
"What is the staffing and budget for the GIS division?"
```
**What happens:** Parallel queries to org chart, position database, budget document. Returns 5 FTE, $2.7M budget, position breakdown (1 manager, 1 principal analyst, 2 journey-level, 1 cadastral mapping technician).

## Comparison Points

### vs. ChatGPT/Generic AI
| Generic AI | SAGE |
|------------|------|
| Knows about zoning in general | Knows Solano County's specific zoning code |
| Can explain what flood zones are | Can tell you which zone your property is in |
| Describes permit processes generically | Cites the actual code sections that apply |
| No connection to your data | Connected to 50+ tools across your systems |

### vs. Keyword Search
| Keyword Search | SAGE |
|----------------|------|
| Returns fragments containing search term | Returns synthesized answers |
| Finds "grading" | Finds grading + the agricultural exemption three sections later |
| User assembles meaning | AI assembles meaning and explains |
| Static results | Refines search based on what it finds |

### vs. Custom Development
| Custom Integration | SAGE |
|-------------------|------|
| Months of development per connection | Tools connect to existing APIs |
| Requires developer for changes | Staff can describe new capabilities |
| Fixed query patterns | Natural language queries |
| 12-24 month timeline | 5 days to working demo |

## Objection Handling

**"AI makes things up."**
> SAGE is connected to authoritative data sources—the same databases your staff use. It's not generating information; it's retrieving and synthesizing from known sources. The AI cites code sections, shows maps from FEMA, pulls assessed values from the assessor.

**"Our staff need to stay experts."**
> This makes your experts more effective, not less necessary. SAGE handles the routine lookups that take 30 minutes each. Your staff focus on the complex cases that actually need human judgment. The institutional knowledge that makes someone valuable can now be encoded and scaled.

**"We tried AI—it didn't work for government."**
> Generic AI fails because it has no connection to your data. SAGE works because it's built on your actual infrastructure. The county code in the database is your county code. The parcels are your parcels. The AI is the interface, not the source.

**"This would take forever to implement."**
> Built in 5 days. Uses standard protocols (MCP) and existing GIS infrastructure. No new databases required. The long pole isn't the technology—it's deciding what problems to solve first.

## Social Media Variants

**LinkedIn (professional):**
> What if AI could answer questions that touch 5 different county systems? SAGE demonstrates how: connected to 152,000 parcels, 7 city zoning codes, FEMA flood data, and 365 pages of county regulations. Built in 5 days. Uses existing infrastructure. #GovTech #AI #GIS

**Twitter/X (concise):**
> "Can I build a winery here?" One question. Five databases. One AI-synthesized answer with code citations. This is what government AI looks like when it's actually connected to government data.

**Technical blog hook:**
> MCP for government GIS: 50+ tools, multimodal map interpretation, regulatory code parsing. Here's how we built an AI agent that actually knows what your zoning code says.
